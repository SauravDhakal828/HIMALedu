                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mb-4">Reference to the context</h3>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. What does the poet mean by ‘the awakening age’?</span><br>
                    The phrase ‘the awakening age’ in the poem refers to a crucial period when the people of Africa, particularly Nigerians, become aware of their true circumstances after enduring years of conflict, poverty, and exploitation. This awakening marks a shift from despair and division toward hope and unity. It represents a time when people realize the importance of peace, solidarity, and collective effort to rebuild their nation following the brutal civil war. The awakening is not only about recognizing past struggles but also about embracing a new vision for a better future.
                    <br><br>
                    In this age of awakening, the poet envisions a society filled with harmony, liberty, creativity, and prosperity. It is a time of renewal when people unite to overcome social, political, and economic challenges and work toward common goals like justice and progress. The “awakening age” is both a literal and symbolic rebirth—an era of enlightenment and transformation that inspires Nigerians to reclaim their dignity and build a peaceful, thriving nation. This concept fills the poem with optimism and faith in the power of hope and collective action.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. Why, in your view, have these people ‘lived with poverty’s rage’?</span><br>
                    These people have ‘lived with poverty’s rage’ because of a combination of historical exploitation, political instability, and internal conflicts. For many years, African countries, including Nigeria, were subjected to exploitation by foreign powers such as Europeans and Americans who extracted natural resources and wealth without benefiting the local people. This long period of injustice deprived the people of opportunities for growth and development, trapping them in poverty.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, prolonged civil wars and ethnic conflicts within these countries further worsened the situation. Political instability meant that governments were weak or corrupt, leading to uneven distribution of resources and wealth, which increased the suffering of ordinary citizens. The people were also burdened by social issues like discrimination, cultural divisions, and lack of education. All these factors combined to create an environment where poverty was widespread and deeply entrenched, causing the people to live with the harsh realities and ‘rage’ of poverty for generations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. Why does the poet appeal for solidarity among the people?</span><br>
                    The poet appeals for solidarity among the people because unity is essential for overcoming the deep divisions and hardships caused by years of war, poverty, and exploitation. After enduring so much suffering, the people need to come together to heal the wounds of the past and build a stronger, more peaceful society. Solidarity creates a sense of collective strength and shared purpose that can inspire hope and motivate positive change. It is through this unity that they can face challenges like inequality, injustice, and social fragmentation more effectively.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, the poet believes that only by standing together can the people realize the dream of a “new world” filled with peace, prosperity, and creativity. Solidarity helps to foster trust, cooperation, and mutual support, which are crucial for progress and development. Without it, the people remain vulnerable to continued conflict and poverty. The poet’s appeal is a call for the community to unite in spirit and action, recognizing that their combined efforts are the key to awakening and transforming their society into one where liberty, harmony, and growth can flourish.

                    <span class="font-bold">d. Does the poet present migration in a positive light? Why? Why not?</span><br>
                    Yes, the poet presents migration in a positive light. Migration is portrayed as a powerful and hopeful process that allows people, particularly the working-age population, to transform their lives and broaden their perspectives. The poet emphasizes that migrants carry with them valuable skills, knowledge, creativity, and capital when they move to new places. These qualities help them grow personally and professionally, which ultimately benefits both the migrants themselves and the societies they return to or remain connected with.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, migration is seen as a catalyst for social and economic progress. Migrants often bring new ideas, innovations, and experiences gained abroad, which can lead to positive changes in their home countries. The poet suggests that migration contributes to a more unified, prosperous, and creative society, as migrants help foster development by sharing their knowledge and resources. Rather than being a loss, migration is viewed as an opportunity for renewal and growth, helping individuals and communities rise above past hardships and contribute to building a better future.

                    <span class="font-bold">e. Nepal is also known for its economic as well as educational migrants. Have you noticed any change in the perceptions and behaviours of these migrants when they return home from abroad?</span><br>
                    Yes, there are noticeable changes in the perceptions and behaviours of Nepali migrants when they return home from abroad, both economically and educationally. Exposure to different cultures, education systems, and work environments broadens their outlook and often transforms their attitudes toward life, work, and society. Many returnees develop a more modern and open-minded approach, valuing education, discipline, and financial literacy more than before.
                    <br><br>
                    They bring back new skills, knowledge, and sometimes capital, which they invest in their communities or businesses. This often leads to positive changes such as adopting innovative ideas, better financial management, and a stronger desire to contribute to Nepal’s development. Additionally, returning migrants tend to have increased awareness of global issues, social equality, and the importance of unity and cooperation, which influences their behaviour and encourages progressive changes in their families and communities.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">f. Relate the rhyme scheme of this sonnet to the kind of life idealized by the poet.</span><br>
                    The rhyme scheme of this sonnet is AA BB CC DD EE FF GG, which consists of seven rhyming couplets. This structured and harmonious pattern reflects the optimism, order, and hope that the poet idealizes in life. Just as the rhyme scheme creates a smooth, rhythmic flow, the poet envisions a life filled with peace, unity, and stability—a world where people live in harmony and work together towards a brighter future.
                    <br><br>
                    The consistent couplets symbolize connection and solidarity, reinforcing the poet’s message that progress and prosperity come from togetherness and shared purpose. The sonorous and rhythmic nature of the rhyme scheme echoes the poet’s dream of a balanced and flourishing society, where optimism and creativity flourish side by side with wisdom and liberty. In this way, the rhyme scheme itself mirrors the idealized life the poet wishes for the people—a life that is orderly, hopeful, and full of promise.
