                        “Sharing Tradition” by Frank LaPena is a thoughtful and inspiring essay that explores the importance of preserving and passing on cultural traditions. LaPena, a Native American artist and writer, emphasizes how stories, rituals, and cultural practices play a vital role in maintaining the identity of a community. He argues that by sharing traditions with younger generations, we ensure the survival of our heritage and values in a rapidly changing world.<br><br>

In the essay, LaPena explains that traditions are not just old customs, but living experiences that shape who we are. They include storytelling, music, dance, ceremonies, and everyday practices that reflect the beliefs of a culture. These traditions are passed on through generations, usually by elders, and hold deep meanings that connect people to their history, land, and ancestors. He believes that without this connection, people can lose their sense of belonging and purpose.<br><br>

The author warns that modern society, especially through technology and Western education, often causes young people to forget or ignore their traditional culture. He believes this is dangerous because it creates a cultural gap between generations. Many elders worry that if young people do not listen, learn, and respect these traditions, their language, identity, and unique way of life could disappear forever. He encourages youth to remain curious and respectful towards the teachings of their community.<br><br>

LaPena also highlights how oral tradition is central to cultural survival. Unlike written records, oral tradition depends on face-to-face sharing, which creates deeper personal bonds and a stronger emotional impact. When an elder tells a story, it’s not just the words that matter, but also the voice, expression, and presence of the storyteller. This process helps listeners feel connected not only to the speaker but to the spiritual world and the wisdom of the ancestors.<br><br>

Importantly, the essay promotes the idea that traditions are not fixed or outdated. They can grow and evolve while still keeping their core values alive. LaPena believes that new generations can adapt traditions to modern life in meaningful ways, as long as they understand and respect the original purpose behind them. This balance between preservation and adaptation is the key to keeping culture relevant and strong.<br><br>

In conclusion, “Sharing Tradition” is a powerful reminder of how crucial it is to listen, learn, and pass on the wisdom of the past. LaPena encourages all people, especially the young, to value their heritage and take responsibility in keeping their culture alive. The essay teaches that traditions are not just about the past—they are about identity, unity, and survival. Without them, we risk losing the richness and meaning of who we are.<br><br>

                        <strong>d. What is the difference between oral tradition and literary tradition?</strong><br>
                        Oral tradition is spoken and shared face-to-face.

                        LaPena says oral tradition inspires artistic creation.

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mt-8 mb-4">Reference to the Context</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>a. LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. If you believe that the oral tradition is important, how would you maintain it?</strong><br>
                        I believe that oral tradition is a powerful way to preserve cultural values, identity, and history. To maintain it, I would start by actively listening to my elders and learning the stories, customs, and teachings they share. These oral teachings carry not only information but also the emotions and experiences of past generations. I would make efforts to record these stories, whether through writing, audio, or video, to ensure they are preserved even if the original speakers are no longer around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to preserving these stories, I would also regularly share them with others—especially the younger generation. This can be done at family gatherings, community events, or through educational programs. Schools and cultural centers can also organize storytelling sessions where elders pass down their knowledge. By creating spaces where people feel encouraged to speak and listen, we can keep oral tradition alive and ensure it continues to shape our identity, moral values, and connection with our roots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>b. “Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.” Explain this statement with reference to the essay.</strong><br>
                        In the essay Sharing Tradition, LaPena emphasizes that elders play a vital role in preserving and passing down cultural values, stories, and traditions through oral communication. However, he also states that not everyone can fulfill these roles because being an elder requires wisdom, experience, responsibility, and a deep understanding of cultural knowledge. It's not just about age—it’s about having the ability and willingness to guide others and share knowledge truthfully and respectfully.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The essay highlights that elders are seen as the bridge between generations, and they must be trusted with the community’s stories and values. If individuals lack commitment, understanding, or a respectful attitude toward their culture, they cannot serve as effective carriers of the oral tradition. Therefore, LaPena suggests that preserving culture through oral tradition depends on finding the right people who can truly uphold the responsibility of the elders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>c. What is the controlling idea or thesis of this essay?</strong><br>
                        The central idea or thesis of Frank LaPena's essay Sharing Tradition is that oral tradition plays a vital role in preserving the cultural identity, history, and values of a community. He emphasizes that stories, teachings, and experiences passed down verbally from elders to younger generations carry deep meanings that help people understand their place in the world. Oral tradition is more than just storytelling—it is a form of education and a spiritual link to ancestors, guiding people in how to live, behave, and honor their culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LaPena also stresses that the loss of oral tradition can weaken the bond between generations and erode the identity of a community. He explains that in the modern world, people often rely heavily on written texts, which may not fully capture the emotions, values, and context carried in oral communication. Therefore, the essay calls for respect toward elders and an active effort to maintain oral practices. By encouraging younger generations to listen and learn from the wisdom of their elders, LaPena highlights the importance of keeping traditions alive through voice, memory, and personal connection.

                        <strong>d. How do topic sentences guide the reader through the essay? What would be lost without them?</strong><br>
                        Topic sentences act as clear signposts at the beginning of each paragraph, introducing the main idea that will be discussed. They help guide the reader through the essay by outlining the structure and focus of each section, making it easier to follow the writer’s argument or explanation step by step. By providing a preview of the content, topic sentences ensure that readers understand the purpose of each paragraph and how it contributes to the overall message of the essay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without topic sentences, the essay would lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult for readers to grasp the main points being made. The flow of ideas would become confusing, and readers might lose track of the writer’s argument or the connections between different parts of the essay. Important details could be overlooked or misunderstood, reducing the overall effectiveness and impact of the essay. In short, topic sentences are essential for maintaining organization and helping readers engage with the text meaningfully.

                        <strong>e. What are the four major problems developed by LaPena with regard to maintaining the oral tradition? How are they used to structure the essay?</strong><br>
                        LaPena outlines four significant problems threatening the continuation of the oral tradition. First, the loss of elders, who are the primary keepers and storytellers of cultural knowledge, means that valuable stories and lessons risk being forgotten. Second, the younger generation often shows a lack of interest in listening to or learning these oral histories, which weakens the transmission of culture. Third, the rise of modern technology and the dominance of written and digital media overshadow oral storytelling, making it less relevant in today’s fast-paced world. Lastly, there is the overarching risk that if oral traditions are not actively preserved, entire cultural identities and knowledge systems may disappear over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LaPena uses these four problems as the backbone of his essay’s structure, dedicating sections to each issue and exploring their impact in detail. This clear organization allows readers to grasp the complexities of maintaining oral traditions in a changing world and underscores the urgency of taking steps to preserve them. By breaking down the challenges this way, LaPena effectively emphasizes why oral tradition remains vital and the efforts needed to keep it alive for future genera

                        <strong>a. Write a paragraph or two explaining your attitude toward the oral tradition of passing along information.</strong><br>
                        I believe the oral tradition of passing along information is incredibly valuable because it preserves culture, history, and wisdom in a way that connects generations personally and meaningfully. Through stories, songs, and spoken words, people not only share facts but also emotions, values, and lessons that help shape identity and community. This tradition keeps the past alive and relevant, allowing younger generations to understand their roots and maintain a sense of belonging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, oral tradition fosters communication skills and strengthens relationships within families and communities. It encourages listening, memory, and storytelling, which are important for cultural continuity. In today’s fast-changing world, where technology often dominates, oral tradition offers a unique, human way of learning and preserving knowledge that should be respected and protected.

                        <strong>b. Our culture is our identity. Write a few paragraphs explaining how you intend to preserve your culture, values and norms.</strong><br>
                        Our culture is indeed the foundation of our identity, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world. To preserve my culture, values, and norms, I intend to actively participate in cultural practices such as festivals, rituals, and traditional ceremonies. By celebrating these events with family and community, I can keep our heritage alive and pass it on to younger generations. Additionally, I will make an effort to learn and use our native language, as language is a powerful carrier of culture and helps maintain a strong connection to our roots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I plan to respect and uphold the values and morals that define our society, such as respect for elders, hospitality, and honesty. I will teach these values to others through my actions and words, serving as a role model in my community. By sharing stories and traditions with friends and family, I can encourage others to appreciate our culture. In this way, I hope to contribute to preserving our unique identity in a rapidly changing world, ensuring that our culture remains a vibrant and guiding force for future generations.
