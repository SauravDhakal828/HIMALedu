                       “How to Live Before You Die” is a powerful and emotional speech delivered by Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc., at a Stanford University graduation ceremony. In this speech, Jobs shares three deeply personal stories from his life that offer lessons about trusting your path, loving what you do, and embracing mortality. His message inspires people, especially young students, to follow their hearts and live meaningfully.<br><br>

In the first story, Jobs talks about connecting the dots. He shares how he dropped out of college because he didn’t see value in spending his parents’ life savings on education that didn’t inspire him. However, after dropping out, he began taking classes that interested him, like calligraphy, which later influenced the design of Apple computers. At the time, these experiences didn’t make sense, but looking back, they all connected. His message is clear: have faith that the dots will connect in the future—even if you don’t see it now.<br><br>

His second story is about love and loss. Jobs describes how he was fired from Apple, the company he founded. This could have been a disaster, but instead, he saw it as a blessing in disguise. Being free allowed him to explore creativity, leading to the creation of NeXT and Pixar, and even falling in love with his wife. Eventually, Apple bought NeXT, and Jobs returned to the company he had started. The core message of this story is that you must find what you love—in work and in life—because that passion will give you strength in difficult times.<br><br>

The third story is the most emotional. Jobs reflects on his experience with cancer and how the awareness of death shaped his outlook on life. He explains that remembering he would die soon helped him avoid fear, pride, and external expectations. It reminded him to focus only on what truly matters. He urges everyone to live each day as if it were their last, because time is limited. His advice is to “stay hungry, stay foolish”, encouraging people to stay curious and bold, and never stop exploring.<br><br>

Throughout the speech, Jobs emphasizes the importance of courage, curiosity, and inner belief. He speaks from real-life struggles, not just success, and this honesty makes his message even more powerful. He teaches that failure is not the end, and that following your intuition and passion is the path to a fulfilling life. His stories are simple, but they carry deep meanings about life, work, and purpose.<br><br>

In conclusion, “How to Live Before You Die” is not just a graduation speech, but a life lesson. Jobs reminds us that life is short and unpredictable, and we should not waste it living someone else’s life. His advice encourages people to follow their hearts, learn from failure, and live fearlessly. This speech continues to inspire millions around the world to make the most of their lives before it's too late.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mb-4">Understanding the text:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>a. What is the story about Steve Jobs’ birth?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs was born to an unwed college student who decided to put him up for adoption. She wanted him to be adopted by an educated family, so he was given to a loving couple who raised him. This beginning shaped Jobs’ life and perspective, teaching him about the importance of fate and the unpredictable paths life can take.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>b. What does he mean when he says, “you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs means that in life, we cannot always understand how our current experiences will shape our future. Only after things have happened, looking back, can we see how different events and decisions fit together and led us to where we are. This encourages trusting the journey even when the path seems unclear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>c. What happened when Steve Jobs turned 30?</strong><br>
                        When Steve Jobs turned 30, he was fired from Apple, the company he had co-founded. This was a very difficult and painful time for him, but it led to a new beginning where he founded new ventures like NeXT and Pixar. Eventually, he returned to Apple and led it to greater success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>d. Jobs contends that you need to love to do what you do in order to be great at it. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</strong><br>
                        I agree with Jobs because passion fuels dedication and perseverance. When you love what you do, you are willing to work hard, overcome challenges, and keep improving. Without love or interest, it’s difficult to maintain motivation and creativity, which are essential for achieving greatness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>e. Is death really life’s greatest invention?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs described death as life’s greatest invention because it is what forces change and renewal. Death clears the old to make way for the new, reminding us to live fully and embrace every moment. It gives meaning and urgency to life, encouraging us to make the most of the limited time we have.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mb-4">Reference to the context:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>a. Read the extract: “We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?” They said: “Of course.”</strong><br>
                        <strong>i. Who was the baby boy?</strong><br>
                        The baby boy was Steve Jobs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>ii. What does ‘do you want him?’ mean?</strong><br>
                        It means they were asking if the couple wanted to adopt the baby boy who was unexpectedly born.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>iii. Who does ‘they’ refer to?</strong><br>
                        ‘They’ refers to the adoptive parents — the couple who were asked if they wanted to adopt the baby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>b. Explain the following lines:</strong><br>
                        <strong>i. “You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”</strong><br>
                        This means that in life, you need to have faith or confidence in something that guides you—whether it’s your instincts, fate, the flow of life, or the idea of karma. This trust helps you make decisions even when the future is uncertain, giving you the courage to follow your own path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>ii. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”</strong><br>
                        This line reminds us that life is short and precious, so we should live authentically—making choices based on our own values and desires, not by trying to meet others’ expectations or conforming to what society wants. It encourages being true to yourself and pursuing your own dreams
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>c. What does he mean by “don’t settle”?</strong><br>
                        When Steve Jobs says “don’t settle,” he is urging people not to accept mediocrity or compromise on what truly matters to them in life. He means that you should never choose a path just because it’s convenient, easy, or expected by others. Settling often happens when people give up on their dreams or passions because of fear, doubt, or pressure from society. Jobs encourages us to keep searching and be patient until we find something that genuinely excites and motivates us. This way, we can live a more meaningful and satisfying life rather than one filled with regret or dissatisfaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, “don’t settle” also means listening to your inner voice and trusting your instincts. Sometimes, the right path may not be clear or easy to follow, but settling for less can lead to unhappiness and missed opportunities. Jobs highlights the importance of perseverance and self-belief, reminding us that life is too short to waste on things that don’t inspire us. By refusing to settle, we open ourselves to new possibilities, growth, and ultimately, greatness in whatever we choose to pursue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs uses a personal, motivational, and conversational style of speech to persuade his audience effectively. Throughout his address, he shares intimate stories from his own life — including his adoption, struggles in college, being fired from Apple, and his confrontation with death. These personal anecdotes make his message more genuine and relatable, helping the audience connect with him emotionally. By opening up about his own challenges and failures, Jobs builds trust and credibility, making his advice more impactful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the speech is highly inspirational and direct, filled with powerful and memorable phrases like “don’t settle,” “stay hungry, stay foolish,” and “your time is limited.” His straightforward language cuts through complexity, motivating listeners to reflect on their own lives and take control of their destinies. He encourages self-belief, resilience, and passion, appealing not just to the mind but also to the heart. This blend of storytelling, simplicity, and emotional appeal characterizes his persuasive style, inspiring the audience to live authentically and fearlessly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>e. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs’ speech is so inspiring?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs’ speech is inspiring because it combines honesty, vulnerability, and powerful life lessons drawn from his own experiences. Instead of giving generic advice, he shares real stories about his struggles, failures, and successes, which makes his message authentic and relatable. When people hear someone openly talk about setbacks like being fired or facing death, it breaks the usual barrier between speaker and audience, creating a strong emotional connection that motivates listeners deeply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, Jobs speaks with passion and conviction, which naturally inspires people to listen and reflect. His clear and direct language, filled with memorable phrases like “don’t settle” and “stay hungry, stay foolish,” stays in the minds of the audience long after the speech is over. He also reminds listeners of the limited time they have, urging them to live meaningfully and follow their own dreams. This combination of personal truth, emotional connection, and motivating calls to action makes his speech powerful and unforgettable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative storytelling technique in his speech? What influence does it have on the audiences?</strong><br>
                        Steve Jobs used the personal narrative storytelling technique in his speech because it helps make his message more authentic, relatable, and memorable. By sharing stories from his own life—like his adoption, dropping out of college, being fired from Apple, and facing death—he shows vulnerability and honesty. This personal approach breaks down barriers between him and the audience, making listeners feel connected to him as a real person rather than just a distant figure giving advice. Storytelling also makes complex ideas easier to understand and remember because people naturally relate to stories better than abstract statements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The influence of this technique on the audience is significant. Personal stories evoke emotions, which engage listeners more deeply and inspire them to reflect on their own lives. It motivates them by showing that even someone as successful as Steve Jobs faced failures and uncertainties, but overcame them by following his passion and trusting his instincts. This builds trust and credibility, encouraging the audience to apply the lessons in their own lives. Overall, storytelling makes his speech more impactful, persuasive, and inspiring.

                    <p>
                        <strong>a. One of Steve Jobs’ mottos was: ‘Think differently’. Can this make a person succeed in life? What challenges are there in thinking differently?</strong><br>
                        Yes, thinking differently can definitely help a person succeed in life. When you think differently, you approach problems and situations with a fresh perspective, which can lead to creative solutions and innovative ideas. This kind of original thinking often sets successful people apart from others because it allows them to see opportunities where others see obstacles. Steve Jobs himself is a perfect example — his unique way of thinking revolutionized industries like computing, music, and mobile phones. Thinking differently encourages breaking away from conventional patterns, taking risks, and imagining possibilities beyond the obvious, which are key ingredients for success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, thinking differently also comes with challenges. One major challenge is resistance from others — people tend to be comfortable with the usual ways of doing things and may criticize or reject new ideas. This can lead to social pressure, doubt, and even isolation. Another challenge is the fear of failure, as trying something new often involves uncertainty and risk. It requires courage and perseverance to continue thinking differently when the results aren’t immediate or when faced with setbacks. Despite these challenges, embracing different thinking can lead to personal growth and remarkable achievements if one remains determined and open-minded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>b. What does the slogan “Stay hungry; stay foolish” mean to you?</strong><br>
                        To me, the slogan “Stay hungry; stay foolish” is a powerful reminder to always keep a strong desire to learn, grow, and achieve more (“stay hungry”) and to remain open-minded and willing to take risks, even if it means making mistakes or looking a little foolish (“stay foolish”). Staying hungry means never becoming complacent or satisfied with what you already know or have achieved — it encourages curiosity and ambition to keep pushing forward. Staying foolish means embracing humility and the willingness to try new things without fear of failure or judgment, understanding that mistakes are part of the learning process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together, this phrase inspires a mindset of continuous exploration and courage. It reminds me that real growth and innovation come when we challenge ourselves, remain curious, and are not afraid to step outside our comfort zones. It’s about keeping the excitement and enthusiasm of a beginner’s mind throughout life, no matter how much success we achieve. This attitude can help us live more fully, creatively, and authentically
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>c. What does it mean to be a visionary? What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?</strong><br>
                        A visionary is someone who has a clear, imaginative, and forward-thinking idea about the future. They can see possibilities and opportunities that others might not notice, and they work toward making those ideas a reality. Being a visionary means having creativity, innovation, and the ability to inspire and lead others toward a goal that may seem uncertain or far off. Visionaries don’t just predict the future — they actively shape it through their actions and decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Steve Jobs was different from a fortune teller because he didn’t simply try to predict what would happen. Instead, he used his vision to create products and technologies that transformed industries and people’s lives. While a fortune teller guesses the future without control, Jobs made his vision come true by combining creativity, hard work, and innovation. He took risks, experimented, and constantly pushed boundaries, turning his dreams into tangible results rather than just predictions.
