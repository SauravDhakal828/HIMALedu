                        In the essay “Human Rights and the Age of Inequality,” Samuel Moyn explores how the modern human rights movement, though powerful in addressing certain injustices, has largely failed to tackle one of the most critical problems of our time: economic inequality. He argues that while human rights campaigns have been successful in promoting basic rights like freedom from torture and access to education, they have not paid enough attention to wealth distribution and economic fairness. As a result, human rights activism has thrived in an era when the gap between the rich and poor has continued to widen globally.<br><br>

Moyn discusses the origin and progress of the human rights movement, especially after World War II, and shows how its focus has primarily been on protecting individuals from state abuse and ensuring minimum standards of life. This includes securing civil liberties and ensuring that people are not deprived of food, education, or healthcare. However, while these goals are necessary, Moyn points out that they do not go far enough. He believes that simply guaranteeing a basic floor of protection does not address the deeper issue of why some people and nations remain extremely rich while others suffer in poverty.<br><br>

He raises the concern that modern human rights law often works within existing political and economic systems rather than challenging them. For instance, corporations and elites can support basic human rights while still promoting economic policies that worsen inequality. As a result, human rights have become more about helping the poor survive than empowering them to rise or change the system. Moyn criticizes this limited approach and urges a broader vision that includes fairness in income and wealth.<br><br>

The essay emphasizes that inequality is not just about poverty, but about power. When a small group of people controls most of the wealth, they also influence politics, laws, and societies in ways that keep them in control. This undermines democracy and justice, even if human rights laws are technically followed. Moyn believes that the human rights movement must recognize this and start addressing issues of unfair distribution and structural injustice.<br><br>

He also points out that many influential institutions that advocate for human rights—like the United Nations, international NGOs, and legal frameworks—are often silent on economic justice. They rarely demand redistribution of wealth or challenge the rules of global capitalism. For Moyn, this is a major failure. He argues that if the human rights movement wants to stay relevant in the 21st century, it must grow to include demands for social and economic equality, not just civil and political protections.<br><br>

In conclusion, Samuel Moyn’s essay is a strong call for expanding the scope of human rights to confront the challenges of economic inequality. He acknowledges the important achievements of the human rights movement but warns that without addressing the root causes of economic injustice, the promise of human dignity and freedom remains incomplete. To truly uphold human rights in today’s world, we must not only defend the vulnerable from harm—but also question and change the systems that keep them vulnerable in the first place.<br><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">a. Does the essay give ways on how to stigmatize inequality? Explain.</span><br>
                    The essay Human Rights and the Age of Inequality does emphasize the importance of recognizing and stigmatizing inequality, though it does not provide a simple or direct list of methods. Instead, it highlights the need for awareness and active engagement in exposing the structural injustices that create and sustain inequality. It suggests that inequality should no longer be seen as a natural or acceptable condition but rather as a moral and social problem that deserves collective condemnation. By bringing economic inequality into the conversation about human rights, the essay calls for society to challenge the systems—like unfair economic policies, exploitation, and unequal distribution of wealth—that perpetuate inequality. This in itself is a powerful way to stigmatize inequality: by refusing to accept it as inevitable and treating it as a serious violation of human rights.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, the essay implies that stigmatizing inequality requires a change in public perception and values, encouraging people to demand more justice and fairness from governments and institutions. This means making inequality visible through education, activism, and media, so people become aware of how it harms social cohesion and human dignity. It calls on individuals, communities, and policymakers to hold powerful entities accountable and to support reforms that promote economic and social rights. Thus, while the essay does not prescribe step-by-step methods, it frames stigmatizing inequality as a societal effort to reject injustice, promote equality, and make economic rights as fundamental as civil and political rights.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. Is another human rights movement necessary? Why?</span><br>
                    Another human rights movement is indeed necessary according to the essay, primarily because the current state of inequality reveals that the earlier movements, while successful in securing political and civil rights, have not fully addressed economic justice. The essay argues that although the Universal Declaration of Human Rights set a landmark by recognizing a broad spectrum of rights, the implementation has been uneven, especially regarding economic and social rights. Inequality continues to grow in many parts of the world, undermining the promise of freedom and dignity for all. Hence, a renewed human rights movement is needed—one that expands the focus beyond legal and political freedoms to include the right to economic security, education, health, and decent living conditions. This new movement must challenge the existing economic systems that allow vast disparities in wealth and power to persist.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, the essay highlights that in today’s globalized world, challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic services are as urgent as ever and demand collective action. The new movement would also have to be more inclusive, involving grassroots organizations, marginalized communities, and international cooperation to ensure that human rights truly become universal. Such a movement would advocate not only for legal reforms but also for economic redistribution, social protection, and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, another human rights movement is necessary because the ideal of human dignity cannot be achieved without addressing the systemic inequalities that deprive millions of their basic rights and opportunities.
