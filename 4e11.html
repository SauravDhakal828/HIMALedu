                    <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4">
                        "The Wish" is a short but powerful story written by Roald Dahl, a British author well known for his fascinating and imaginative storytelling. The story focuses on a young boy and his vivid imagination, revealing how fear and courage shape a person’s actions and thoughts. Although short in length, the story explores deep psychological themes such as imagination, childhood fear, loneliness, and inner strength.<br><br>

The story begins with a young boy lying alone on the floor of his house. As he observes the patterned carpet, his imagination begins to transform it into something magical and dangerous. The carpet becomes a kind of fantasy world in his mind. He imagines that the black parts of the carpet are burning coals that will burn him if he steps on them, the red patches are poisonous snakes, and only the yellow parts are safe zones that he can walk on.<br><br>

The boy sets himself a challenge: if he can walk across the entire carpet by stepping only on the yellow patches, he will win a wonderful reward. If he fails, the consequences will be terrible—he will be burned or bitten. He believes that if he succeeds, he will get what he wishes for—perhaps a puppy, or something else he longs for deeply.<br><br>

This imaginary game becomes very real to him. He carefully and slowly begins his journey across the dangerous carpet. Every step is intense, and the stakes feel incredibly high to the boy. As he moves forward, the yellow patches become smaller and harder to reach. The fear in his mind grows stronger. His heart races, and he becomes sweaty and nervous, but he keeps going, trying to be brave.<br><br>

However, as he approaches the most difficult part of the carpet, he hesitates. One yellow patch is too far to reach safely. His fear overtakes his courage. He stretches out his hand to balance himself, but in that moment of distraction, he slips. His finger touches a black patch, and he screams in terror, convinced that he has been burned.<br><br>

The story ends suddenly and mysteriously, with the boy screaming and his mother calling out to him from another room. It leaves the reader wondering whether the events were real or only happening in the boy’s mind.<br><br>

                        <span class="font-bold">a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they?</span><br>
                        In The Wish, the writer skillfully creates two distinct voices that give the story its unique depth and charm.
                        <br><br>
                        The Child’s Voice: This voice represents the perspective of the young boy, full of innocence, imagination, and curiosity. Through the child’s eyes, ordinary things like the carpet become a vast and mysterious world full of adventure and wonder. The child’s voice is playful and vivid, capturing the feelings of excitement, fear, and discovery as he explores the patterns on the carpet. It reflects the natural way children perceive the world around them — magical and full of possibilities.
                        <br><br>
                        The Adult’s (Narrator’s) Voice: This voice belongs to the narrator, who speaks from a more mature and reflective viewpoint. The narrator provides explanations and observations about the child’s behavior and thoughts. This voice is calm, clear, and objective, helping the reader understand what is actually happening beneath the child’s imaginative experience. The adult voice acts as a bridge between the child’s fantasy and reality, offering insights that the child might not fully grasp yet.
                        <br><br>
                        By blending these two voices, the writer creates a rich narrative that contrasts the lively imagination of childhood with the more grounded understanding of adulthood. This interplay helps readers connect emotionally with the child’s wonder while also appreciating the story’s deeper meanings about growth, perception, and innocence.

                        <span class="font-bold">b. Read the extract and answer:</span><br>
                        “…the black parts are snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks around the middle, and if I touch one of them, I’ll be bitten and I’ll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.”
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="font-bold">i. What does ‘the black part’ mean?</span><br>
                        The ‘black parts’ refer to the black patterns or designs on the red carpet. To the child’s imaginative mind, these black areas look like dangerous snakes—poisonous adders and cobras—making the carpet seem like a threatening and mysterious place.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="font-bold">ii. Who is the speaker?</span><br>
                        The speaker is the child who is walking on the carpet. He is imagining the black patterns as real snakes and expressing his fears and hopes while trying to cross the carpet safely.
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="font-bold">iii. Why doesn’t the speaker want to be burnt?</span><br>
                        The child is afraid of being burnt because, in his imagination, some parts of the carpet are like fire or dangerous traps. Being burnt represents danger and harm. He wants to avoid being burnt so that he can safely reach the other side of the carpet and be rewarded with a puppy for his birthday, which motivates him to be careful.

                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?</span><br>
                        In The Wish, the writer uses vivid images and metaphors to bring the child’s imagination to life and to deepen the story’s meaning. Here are some key examples:
                        <br><br>
                        -The Carpet as a Dangerous Jungle or Battlefield:
                        The carpet’s red surface with black patterns is imagined by the child as a perilous landscape filled with threats. The black patterns become “snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras” — this metaphor transforms the carpet into a wild, dangerous place, making the child’s journey across it a thrilling adventure.
                        <br><br>
                        -Snakes as Symbols of Danger:
                        The black parts of the carpet are not just patterns but metaphorically described as snakes that can bite and kill. This metaphor captures the child’s fear and the feeling of risk as he steps carefully to avoid harm.
                        <br><br>
                        -The Carpet as a Trial or Test:
                        The child’s effort to cross the carpet without being burnt or bitten serves as a metaphor for overcoming obstacles or challenges. It symbolizes a rite of passage or a test of courage and determination.
                        <br><br>
                        -Imagery of Fire and Burning:
                        The idea of being “burnt” represents danger and pain, adding intensity to the child’s imagined journey. This image highlights the stakes of the child’s adventure and his strong desire to avoid harm.
                        <br><br>
                        These images and metaphors together create a vivid, imaginative world that reflects the child’s adventurous spirit and his wish to be brave and rewarded. They also help readers understand how a simple everyday object—the carpet—can become a magical and meaningful experience through a child’s eyes.

                        <span class="font-bold">d. Summarize the short story “The Wish” in about 200 words.</span><br>
                        The Wish is a charming short story that beautifully captures the vivid imagination and adventurous spirit of a young child. The story revolves around a boy who becomes fascinated by a large red carpet with intricate black patterns spread across the floor. To an adult, the carpet is just a decorative household item, but to the child, it transforms into a vast, mysterious landscape filled with danger and excitement. The child imagines the black patterns as deadly snakes—adders and cobras—that are thick and menacing, ready to bite anyone who steps on them. The red parts of the carpet appear to him as patches of burning fire, threatening to scorch and harm him if he makes a wrong step.
                        <br><br>
                        Despite the fear these imagined dangers inspire, the child is determined to cross the carpet safely. His motivation comes from the promise of a birthday gift—a puppy—that he will receive if he manages to reach the other side without being bitten or burnt. This promise fuels his courage and persistence, turning a simple walk across a carpet into a thrilling quest. The story highlights how a child’s mind can transform everyday objects into magical worlds full of challenges and rewards.
                        <br><br>
                        Through vivid imagery and rich metaphors, The Wish explores themes of innocence, bravery, and the power of imagination. It reflects a child’s desire to grow, explore, and be rewarded for their bravery. The story also subtly reminds readers of how imagination shapes childhood experiences, making the ordinary extraordinary. Ultimately, The Wish is a celebration of childhood wonder and the boundless creativity found in a child’s view of the world.

                        <span class="font-bold">e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles, who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?</span><br>
                        In The Wish, the child’s perspective presents a more interesting and effective view for readers because it brings the story to life with vivid imagination and emotional depth. Through the child’s eyes, an ordinary carpet transforms into a dangerous world filled with snakes and fire. This imaginative viewpoint captures the excitement, fear, and curiosity of childhood, making the story engaging and relatable. Readers can connect with the child’s adventurous spirit and sense of wonder, which adds emotional richness to the narrative.
                        <br><br>
                        The narrator’s voice, on the other hand, offers a calm and clear explanation of the events, helping readers understand the reality behind the child’s fantasy. While this perspective provides important context, it is less emotionally captivating. Overall, the child’s imaginative viewpoint is more compelling because it allows readers to experience the story’s magic and innocence directly, which is at the heart of the story’s appeal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">f. Is “The Wish” a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your arguments.</span><br>
                        The Wish is mainly a story about self-confidence overcoming fear rather than greed. The central focus is on a young boy who faces his imagined fears—poisonous snakes and burning fire—while trying to cross a carpet. These fears represent the challenges and dangers we all face in life. Despite being scared, the child shows determination and courage by carefully making his way across the carpet, which symbolizes the power of confidence and bravery in overcoming obstacles. The story celebrates how imagination and inner strength help the child face and conquer his fears.
                        <br><br>
                        Although the child is motivated by the promise of a puppy as a birthday gift, this desire does not reflect greed. Instead, it acts as a positive incentive that encourages him to be brave and complete the challenging journey. The wish for the puppy is innocent and natural—it symbolizes hope and reward for his courage rather than selfishness. The story does not portray the child’s desire negatively but rather shows how having a goal can inspire confidence and persistence. In this way, The Wish conveys an inspiring message about growth, courage, and the role of motivation in overcoming fear, rather than focusing on greed or selfishness.

                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?</span><br>
                        Yes, I believe our wishes can be fulfilled, but it often depends on several factors like our effort, determination, and sometimes, circumstances beyond our control. A wish alone is just a hope or desire, but when combined with hard work, patience, and persistence, it can become a reality. For example, if someone wishes to succeed in their studies or career and works consistently toward their goal, their wish has a good chance of coming true.
                        <br><br>
                        However, not all wishes are easily fulfilled because some may be unrealistic or depend on factors outside our influence. Sometimes, fulfilling a wish requires time, preparation, or support from others. So, while a wish is a starting point and a source of motivation, turning it into reality requires action and dedication. In summary, wishes can come true if we believe in them and put in the necessary effort, but they are not fulfilled by mere hoping.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="font-bold">b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to overcome it?</span><br>
                        Some people might have a frightening nature due to a variety of reasons. Often, past negative experiences such as failures, trauma, or harsh criticism can cause fear and anxiety. When someone has faced difficulties or rejection before, they may become hesitant to try new things or take risks. Additionally, lack of self-confidence and low self-esteem can make people doubt their abilities, which increases fear. Fear of the unknown or uncertainty about the future also contributes to a frightening nature because it makes people feel unsafe or unprepared.
                        <br><br>
                        To overcome such fear, it is important to take small steps toward facing what scares them. Gradual exposure to feared situations helps build courage and confidence over time. Setting achievable goals and celebrating small successes can boost self-belief. It is also helpful to maintain a positive mindset and remind oneself that mistakes are part of learning and growth. Seeking support from friends, family, or counselors can provide encouragement and guidance. Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation can reduce anxiety. Finally, imagining positive outcomes and focusing on what can be controlled empowers individuals to face their fears bravely and gradually overcome their frightening nature.
