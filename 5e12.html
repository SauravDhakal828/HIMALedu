In the concluding lines, the poet expresses a wish to return to the old home and relive the precious moments of his childhood. The poem ends on a hopeful note, emphasizing that although time moves on, the emotional bond with one’s roots remains eternal. Mishra’s words invite readers to cherish their own memories and appreciate the places that have shaped their lives.<br><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">a. How does the narrator describe his feeling at the arrival of his old home?</span><br>
                    The narrator experiences a mixture of emotions upon arriving at his old home. Initially, he feels pleasure and happiness as memories of his childhood flood back to him. His hometown, which once appeared lovely with a green sky overhead, filled with vibrant life, now seems completely changed. Instead of the bright and lively scene he remembered, he sees a vast, grey, and gloomy sky, with the surroundings looking deserted and lifeless. The condition of his home is in stark contrast to what it was in his youth, and this change makes him nostalgic as he reflects on how his childhood has been deceived by time.

                    <span class="font-bold">b. What were the three kinds of servants in China then? What does it indicate about contemporary Chinese society?</span><br>
                    In the story, the narrator describes three kinds of servants in contemporary Chinese society: dailies, yearlong servants, and busy-mothers. Dailies, also known as short-timers, worked only for a day or short periods, while yearlong servants worked continuously for a family throughout the year or longer. Busy-mothers were landowners who worked for one family at specific times, such as during festivals or when rent was due. This classification highlights the structured and hierarchical nature of Chinese society at the time, where labor and social roles were divided rigidly. It reflects a system resembling servitude or slavery and shows how social divisions influenced the allocation of work and status.

                    <span class="font-bold">c. What makes the narrator nostalgic? What did he do with Runtu in his teenage years?</span><br>
                    The narrator’s nostalgia is triggered by his mother’s suggestion to meet his childhood friend, Runtu. This brings back memories of his carefree teenage years spent with Runtu. During their youth, they shared many joyful activities such as catching birds by clever tricks and hunting the Zha bird by stabbing it. They also enjoyed collecting colorful shells like reds, blues, and ghost-scarers, and they went out searching for badgers and porcupines. These shared adventures remind the narrator of a simpler, happier time, deepening his feelings of nostalgia.

                    Runtu showed remarkable skill even at a young age when he hunted a Zha bird. While standing guard over watermelons, he suddenly attacked the bird with a pointed knife. This quick and unexpected move allowed him to successfully kill the Zha, demonstrating his ability and courage as a young hunter.

                    The narrator creates a humorous image of Mrs. Yang by likening her to a “beancurd beauty” with narrow cheekbones and thin lips. He notes that she powdered her face, but humorously describes her facial features as if measured by two compasses from a geometry box, creating an exaggerated and comical picture. This playful description adds a lighthearted tone to the narrative and shows the narrator’s wit in portraying characters.

                    <span class="font-bold">f. According to the narrator, what were different factors that made Runtu a poor man throughout his life?</span><br>
                    Runtu’s lifelong poverty is attributed to a variety of interconnected factors. Social obligations and rigid class divisions limited his opportunities and freedom. His economic background was weak, and he faced discrimination during his prime years. Additionally, adverse conditions such as poor harvests, famine, heavy taxes, and exploitation by the gentry worsened his financial situation. The burden of supporting many children also strained his resources. Together, these challenges kept Runtu in a state of persistent poverty throughout his life.

                    Before departing from his old home, the narrator offers tangible help to Runtu, who is struggling financially. He gifts Runtu household items such as two large tables, a few candles, an incense burner, and a set of scales. This gesture is a way of easing Runtu’s difficult life and demonstrates the narrator’s kindness and the enduring nature of their friendship, despite the social and economic differences between them.

                    The author distinguishes between two types of idols in the story: superstitious idols and hope. Superstitious idols are worshipped for short-term benefits and immediate desires, representing fleeting beliefs that people cling to when they want quick results. In contrast, hope is described as a long-term, enduring faith that sustains people through difficult times. Hope is portrayed as a deeper and more meaningful idol that offers lasting comfort and resilience beyond temporary wishes.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. While reading the friendship between the narrator and Runtu, Hindu readers remember the friendship between Krishna and Sudama. Which particular description reminds you of the mythological example?</span><br>
                    While reading about the friendship between the narrator and Runtu, Hindu readers are often reminded of the timeless friendship between Krishna and Sudama, a story well-known from the Mahabharata. Both friendships share striking similarities that highlight the essence of true companionship beyond social and economic boundaries. In the story, Xun, the narrator’s friend, is wealthy, whereas Runtu lives a life of poverty and hardship, just as Krishna was a king and Sudama a poor Brahmin. This contrast in their social status evokes the same feelings of humility and shame experienced by Sudama when he visited Krishna. Similarly, Runtu feels ashamed to meet Xun, believing himself unworthy due to his poverty. Despite these differences, both friendships are marked by genuine affection, respect, and a deep bond that transcends material wealth. This portrayal emphasizes the idea that true friendship is not dependent on riches or status but is grounded in loyalty, kindness, and understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, the way both stories depict the reunion between the friends further strengthens this connection. Krishna warmly welcomes Sudama with love and generosity, transforming Sudama’s humble hut into a palace and ensuring his happiness. In parallel, Xun shows his care by helping Runtu with household goods and support, trying to ease the difficulties in his friend’s life. These actions highlight the virtue of compassion in friendship and teach a valuable moral lesson—that true friends support each other selflessly, regardless of their social positions. The stories remind readers that wealth cannot break genuine friendships and that a pure heart and mutual respect are the foundations of lasting relationships. This enduring message resonates deeply within the cultural and moral fabric of both stories, making the friendship between Xun and Runtu reminiscent of the legendary bond between Krishna and Sudama.

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. How does the story support the proposition that the relationships of childhood are innocent, impartial and disinterested?</span><br>
                    The story My Old Home strongly supports the idea that childhood relationships are innocent, impartial, and disinterested by portraying the pure friendship between Xun and Runtu. As children, they share a bond that is free from the complexities of social class, wealth, or status. Their friendship is based solely on mutual affection and shared experiences, without any expectation of gain or advantage. The story emphasizes how children do not understand or care about societal divisions like rich or poor, upper or lower class. They simply enjoy each other’s company and build genuine connections. This innocence is reflected in the way Xun and Runtu play, hunt, and explore together without any prejudice or concern about their different social standings.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, the story illustrates how this pure childhood bond remains unaffected by the passing of time and changing circumstances. Even though Runtu grows poor and struggles in life, and Xun becomes wealthy, their friendship continues to be marked by genuine care and respect. Xun’s willingness to help Runtu by giving him household items before leaving his old home shows the lasting nature of their disinterested friendship. Unlike many adult relationships that may be influenced by selfish motives or social expectations, the friendship in the story remains untainted and sincere, proving that childhood relationships are often the most honest and unconditional kind. This contrast between the simplicity of childhood bonds and the complexities of adult social divisions is a central theme in the story.

                    <span class="font-bold">c. After reading the story, what inferences can you make about the contemporary Chinese economic and social system?</span><br>
                    After reading My Old Home, several important inferences can be made about the contemporary Chinese economic and social system depicted in the story. The narrative reveals a society deeply divided by class and economic disparity. Agriculture appears to be the primary occupation, but it provides meager income, leaving many, like Runtu, struggling to meet even their basic needs. This agricultural dependence results in widespread poverty and hardship for the lower classes. The story highlights the lack of social mobility, as people born into poverty remain trapped due to economic challenges such as poor harvests, famine, and harsh taxes. These factors keep the majority in a cycle of deprivation, unable to improve their living conditions.
                    <br><br>
                    Socially, the story illustrates a rigid hierarchical structure that governs relationships and labor. The classification of servants into dailies, yearlongs, and busy-mothers shows a system where work and social roles are strictly divided based on status. There is a clear division between the rich and the poor, and inter-class relationships are restricted or frowned upon. This rigid social stratification, combined with economic hardships, fosters discrimination and limits opportunities for the lower class. The story’s depiction of these social and economic conditions reflects a narrow-minded and inhumane system that marginalizes the poor, showing a society struggling with inequality, limited progress, and entrenched social boundaries.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">d. What does the story indicate about the geographical features of the narrator’s hometown?</span><br>
                    The story My Old Home vividly portrays the geographical features of the narrator’s hometown, contrasting the vibrant landscape of his childhood with the bleakness he encounters upon his return. In his early years, the narrator describes his hometown as a beautiful place under a green, blue-black sky, surrounded by lush greenery and fertile land filled with vegetables and grasses. The environment was lively and full of natural beauty, with birds flying freely around his garden and house. This idyllic setting reflects a close connection between the people and nature, highlighting the simplicity and richness of rural life during that time.
                    <br><br>
                    However, when the narrator returns after many years, he finds that the once vibrant landscape has drastically changed. The green sky has turned vast and grey, giving an impression of desolation and gloom. The land appears barren and lifeless, stripped of its former beauty and vitality. This transformation symbolizes not only environmental degradation but also the loss of the warmth and vitality that once defined the narrator’s hometown. The story hints at changes brought by time, possibly due to neglect or unplanned development, which have robbed the area of its natural charm and left it desolate. Through these descriptions, the story reflects on the impact of changing times on both the physical environment and the emotional connection people have with their roots.
