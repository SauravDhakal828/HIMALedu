                    <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                        “A Red, Red Rose” is a beautiful and romantic poem written by the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns. It is a classic love poem that expresses deep, passionate, and eternal love for a beloved. The poet uses natural imagery and simple yet powerful language to communicate the strength and permanence of his emotions.<br><br>

The poem begins with a simile comparing the speaker’s love to a freshly bloomed red rose in June. Just like a rose that is full of beauty and life, the poet’s love is young, fresh, and full of passion. The phrase “O my Luve's like a red, red rose” is repeated for emphasis, showing how strongly he feels. In the next line, he compares his love to a sweet melody that is “sweetly played in tune.” This shows that his love is not only beautiful like a flower but also harmonious, soothing, and pleasant like music.<br><br>

The second stanza highlights the depth and sincerity of the poet’s feelings. He says that his love is “deep” and will remain constant and unchanging, even if the world changes. He addresses his beloved as “my bonnie lass” (a Scottish term for a beautiful girl), and promises that he will love her until the seas dry up. This is a hyperbolic expression—he doesn’t literally mean the sea will dry up, but uses the image to emphasize the endless nature of his love.<br><br>

In the third stanza, the poet continues with more hyperbole. He vows to love his beloved until the rocks melt with the sun and until time itself ends. These lines reinforce the idea that his love is not temporary, but eternal and unbreakable. His emotions are beyond the limits of time and space.<br><br>

In the final stanza, the tone becomes a little more melancholic, as the speaker says farewell to his beloved. He seems to be going away for some time but promises that he will return, even if the journey is long—“though it were ten thousand mile.” This shows his loyalty and commitment. No matter how far or how long the separation, he assures her that nothing can keep them apart.<br><br>

                        <li>
                            <strong>a. What can you infer about the speaker’s devotion to his beloved from the following lines?</strong>
                            <p>In the poem “A Red, Red Rose,” the speaker expresses an intense and heartfelt devotion to his beloved through vivid and lasting imagery. From the very beginning, he compares his love to a “red, red rose” newly sprung in June and to a sweetly played melody, symbolizing beauty, freshness, and harmony. Throughout the poem, the speaker promises to love his beloved until impossible things happen — like the seas drying up and the rocks melting with the sun. These hyperbolic images show that his love is not only strong but eternal and unchanging, surpassing even the natural laws of the world. The continuous use of natural elements such as seas, rocks, and sands reflects the depth and timeless nature of his feelings.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the poem reveals the speaker’s devotion despite physical separation, as he speaks of traveling a thousand miles away from his beloved. Even with this distance, he assures her that his love will remain steadfast and true. The repeated emphasis on time — “while the sands o’ life shall run” — suggests a lifelong commitment, highlighting the sincerity and passion in his promises. Overall, the poem conveys a love that is both tender and powerful, unshaken by distance or time, portraying the speaker’s unwavering and eternal devotion to his beloved.</p>

                            <strong>b. What is the theme of the poem?</strong>
                            <p>The central theme of “A Red, Red Rose” is the enduring and everlasting nature of true love.

It portrays love as a powerful and sincere emotion that can withstand challenges such as distance and the passage of time.

This theme celebrates love as an unwavering force that provides emotional strength and connection, suggesting that real love is something pure, beautiful, and eternal.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the poem conveys the idea that love is not just a fleeting feeling but a lifelong commitment filled with sincerity and intensity.

                            <strong>c. Paraphrase the whole poem into simple prose form.</strong>
                            <p>The speaker begins by expressing his love for his beloved, comparing it to a fresh, bright red rose that has just blossomed in the month of June. He also likens his love to a beautiful and sweet melody that is perfectly in tune. These comparisons show that his love is fresh, sincere, and full of life. He promises to love his beloved deeply and truly for a very long time, emphasizing that his feelings are genuine and heartfelt.</p>
                            <p>He goes on to make strong promises about the endurance of his love. He says that he will continue to love her until the seas dry up and the rocks melt from the heat of the sun, which are impossible events, meaning his love will last forever. Even if he has to travel a thousand miles away, he assures her that his love will remain constant and faithful. The speaker’s words show that no distance or time can weaken his devotion, and he will stay true to his beloved until they are reunited again.</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>d. Analyze the poem in terms of literary devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.</strong>
                            <p><strong>Simile:</strong></p>
                            <p>The poem opens with similes that compare the speaker’s love to a “red, red rose” and to “a melody sweetly played in tune.” These similes help convey the freshness, beauty, and sweetness of his love by linking it to familiar, pleasant experiences.</p>
                            <p><strong>Symbolism:</strong></p>
                            <p>The “red, red rose” symbolizes passionate and romantic love. Roses often represent love and beauty, and the repetition of “red” emphasizes intensity. The “seas” and “rocks” symbolize the natural world and its permanence, which the speaker contrasts with his own enduring love that will last even longer.</p>
                            <p><strong>Imagery:</strong></p>
                            <p>Burns uses vivid imagery throughout the poem to evoke strong sensory experiences. The image of a newly sprung red rose conjures a visual of freshness and vitality. The “melody” evokes an auditory image, adding to the emotional effect. Natural elements like drying seas and melting rocks create powerful, almost impossible scenarios that emphasize the speaker’s eternal love.</p>
                            <p><strong>Alliteration:</strong></p>
                            <p>The poem features alliteration, such as the repetition of the 's' sound in “seas gang dry” and “sands o’ life.” This soft repetition adds musicality and rhythm to the poem, enhancing its lyrical quality.</p>
                            <p><strong>Assonance:</strong></p>
                            <p>There is assonance in the repeated vowel sounds, such as the long “ee” sound in “melody sweetly” which makes the poem sound smooth and flowing. This contributes to the overall melodic and harmonious effect of the poem.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.</strong>
                            <p>Hyperbole is a literary device that involves deliberate exaggeration to emphasize a point or express strong feelings. It is not meant to be taken literally but is used to create a dramatic effect and make the emotions or ideas more powerful and vivid for the reader.</p>
                            <p>In “A Red, Red Rose,” Robert Burns uses hyperbole to stress the depth and intensity of the speaker’s love. For example, the lines:</p>
                            <p>“Till a’ the seas gang dry” (until all the seas dry up)</p>
                            <p>“And the rocks melt wi’ the sun” (and the rocks melt with the heat of the sun)</p>
                            <p>are clear exaggerations because seas cannot realistically dry up and rocks cannot melt in the sun’s heat. These hyperboles serve to express that the speaker’s love will last beyond natural and impossible events, emphasizing that it is eternal and unchanging. By using such grand and impossible images, the poet powerfully conveys the strength and endless nature of his feelings.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.</strong>
                            <p>A refrain is a repeated line or group of lines that appears regularly throughout a poem, usually at the end of stanzas. It plays an important role in giving the poem a musical rhythm and structure, which can make it more engaging and memorable. Refrains also serve to emphasize the main themes or emotions of the poem, reinforcing the poet’s message each time the lines are repeated. This repetition can create a sense of continuity and help build emotional intensity as the poem progresses.</p>
                            <p>In “A Red, Red Rose,” Robert Burns uses the refrain to highlight the speaker’s deep and eternal love for his beloved. The repeated lines “And I will love thee still, my dear, / Till a’ the seas gang dry” occur in multiple stanzas, underlining the speaker’s vow of everlasting devotion. This refrain not only strengthens the poem’s central theme of undying love but also gives the poem a lyrical, song-like quality that enhances its emotional impact. By repeating this promise, the poet ensures that the reader fully grasps the sincerity and passion behind the speaker’s words, making the declaration of love feel more powerful and heartfelt.</p>

                            <strong>a. What kind of love is expressed in "A Red, Red Rose"?</strong>
                            <p>The love expressed in “A Red, Red Rose” is a deeply passionate and sincere romantic love. The speaker’s affection is fresh and vibrant, like a newly blossomed rose, symbolizing beauty and tenderness. This love is not casual or fleeting; instead, it is heartfelt and genuine, filled with emotion and sweetness. The speaker’s comparisons to natural and beautiful things like a rose and a melody suggest that his feelings are pure and full of admiration. The tone of the poem conveys a strong emotional connection and warmth, showing how much the beloved means to him.</p>
                            <p>Beyond its passion, the poem also expresses an enduring and eternal love that transcends time and distance. The speaker promises to love his beloved until impossible things happen, such as the seas drying up and the rocks melting. These exaggerations highlight the lasting and unchanging nature of his devotion. Even if he must travel far away, his love remains steadfast and true. This idealistic love is marked by loyalty, faithfulness, and a deep emotional bond that remains strong regardless of challenges. Ultimately, the poem celebrates a love that is both tender and powerful, lasting a lifetime and beyond.</p>

                            <strong>b. Do you think that love has power? Why do poets compose poems addressing their beloved?</strong>
                            <p>Love is one of the most powerful emotions that humans experience. It has the ability to inspire, transform, and deeply affect people’s thoughts and actions. Love can bring immense joy and comfort, as well as vulnerability and longing. It connects people on a profound level, creating bonds that can withstand challenges like distance, time, and hardship. Because of this strength, love often serves as a driving force behind many decisions and creative expressions, influencing not only personal lives but also culture and art.</p>
                            <p>Poets compose poems addressing their beloved to express these deep emotions in a way that words alone often cannot capture in everyday conversation. Poetry allows them to explore the complexities of love—its beauty, pain, passion, and devotion—through vivid imagery, rhythm, and carefully chosen language. By writing to their beloved, poets create intimate, emotional connections and preserve their feelings in a lasting form. These poems celebrate love’s power and immortalize the poet’s devotion, making their personal experiences universal and relatable to readers across time and cultures.</p>

                            <strong>c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</strong>
                            <p>Poetry is a unique form of writing that captures and expresses the deepest feelings and emotions of the poet. Unlike ordinary writing, poetry uses carefully chosen words, rhythm, and imagery to convey emotions in a powerful and condensed way. It allows poets to share their experiences of love, joy, sorrow, anger, or hope in a way that touches the reader’s heart. Through poetry, emotions become vivid and alive, creating a strong connection between the poet and the audience. This emotional expression makes poetry a timeless and universal art form.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, poetry often uses literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and symbolism to represent emotions indirectly, making the feelings more impactful and memorable. Instead of simply stating facts, poetry paints pictures with words that evoke moods and feelings, allowing readers to experience the poet’s inner world. Because emotions are central to human life, poetry remains an important way to understand and communicate the complex range of human experiences. In this way, poetry is truly the expression of feeling and emotions.</p>
