                         In the essay “On Libraries,” the renowned neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks reflects on his deep and lifelong love for books and libraries. He begins by sharing his personal memories of how, as a child, he was introduced to books and reading. Sacks fondly recalls the British libraries he visited with his mother and describes the libraries not just as buildings filled with books, but as magical places where knowledge, imagination, and discovery could thrive. His personal stories highlight how libraries shaped his identity, curiosity, and career.<br><br>

Sacks describes libraries as a kind of sacred space—peaceful, quiet, and full of potential. He believes that libraries are among the most important institutions in society because they provide access to ideas, culture, and history, freely available to everyone regardless of background. He emphasizes how important it is that people, especially children and young learners, are exposed to a wide range of books and subjects. For Sacks, a library is not just about reading but about the adventure of learning and exploring ideas.<br><br>

He also reflects on the changes in the modern world, particularly the shift from printed books to digital screens. While he acknowledges the usefulness of technology and the internet, he expresses concern that the sensory and emotional experience of reading physical books in libraries is slowly disappearing. He believes that touching, smelling, and browsing through physical books creates a unique relationship with knowledge that cannot be fully replaced by digital devices.<br><br>

Throughout the essay, Sacks emphasizes that libraries are crucial for both individual and collective memory. They hold the thoughts of past generations and pass them on to the future. Without libraries, he warns, societies risk losing not just books but also the habits of thoughtful reading, critical thinking, and reflection. He argues that the value of a library cannot be measured simply in economic terms—it is a treasure of civilization that must be preserved.<br><br>

As a scientist and writer, Sacks finds libraries essential for his intellectual growth. He talks about how spending time in libraries allowed him to make unexpected connections between subjects, leading to some of his greatest insights. He believes libraries are places where creativity can bloom and where the imagination is constantly nourished by the wealth of knowledge available within.<br><br>

In conclusion, “On Libraries” is a heartfelt tribute to the importance of books, reading, and the quiet sanctuaries that libraries offer. Oliver Sacks views libraries not just as places to read, but as spaces that nurture minds and preserve human wisdom. Through his personal reflections and deep respect for learning, he reminds readers that libraries are a vital part of a thoughtful and educated society—and that they must be cherished, protected, and used.<br><br>

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mb-4">Reference to the Context</h3>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. The author says, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.” Justify it with the textual evidences.</span><br>
                    In his essay “On Libraries,” Oliver Sacks admits, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.” This statement reflects the distinction he makes between traditional classroom learning and his own unique approach to acquiring knowledge. He considered himself a poor student in school because he did not perform well in the conventional academic setting. He often found school boring and disliked receiving instructions from teachers. Lessons in class would often go in one ear and out the other, as he lacked interest in the rigid structure of formal education.
                    <br><br>
                    However, Sacks was not inattentive—he was actually a very active and curious learner, especially when left to explore knowledge on his own. He loved listening to teachers and later verifying or expanding that knowledge in the library. He used libraries to cross-check what he had heard in class and to delve deeper into subjects that sparked his interest. This behavior shows that while he may not have been a model pupil in school by academic standards, he was an excellent listener in the broader sense—a listener who engaged deeply with knowledge and sought to understand it through his own efforts.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, through this statement, Sacks emphasizes that real learning doesn’t always happen in classrooms—it often happens through listening, exploring, and thinking independently, especially in libraries.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. A proverb says, “Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library.” Does this proverb apply in the essay? Explain.</span><br>
                    Yes, the proverb “Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library” perfectly applies to the essay “On Libraries” by Oliver Sacks. In this autobiographical piece, Sacks shares his lifelong love for books and the pleasure he found in libraries. From a very young age, he was deeply drawn to the peaceful and intellectually stimulating atmosphere of libraries. He often got lost in books and could spend hours roaming the shelves, choosing whatever caught his interest. This freedom to explore and learn at his own pace gave him immense joy—far more than he ever experienced in school.
                    <br><br>
                    For Sacks, libraries were not just buildings with books; they were sacred spaces of discovery, imagination, and self-guided learning. He recalls fond memories of sitting at large wooden tables, surrounded by piles of books, and enjoying the quiet companionship of other readers. He felt happiest when he could explore freely, without strict rules or fixed syllabuses. The essay also describes how he continued to visit different libraries throughout his life, from his childhood home to the Queen’s College at Oxford, always feeling at peace among books.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, the proverb is highly relevant to the essay because it captures the core emotion that Sacks conveys: a deep, personal pleasure in the quiet act of discovering knowledge through books in a library.

                    <span class="font-bold">c. Are there any other services that you would like to see added to the library?</span><br>
                    Yes, there are several services that could be added to libraries to make them more accessible, comfortable, and engaging for readers of all ages and interests. One important addition would be separate reading areas for different age groups—such as children, teenagers, adults, and senior citizens. This would allow people to find books suited to their age and interests in a more focused environment. For example, children may prefer colorful storybooks and comics, while adults and elders may enjoy literature, history, philosophy, or scientific texts.
                    <br><br>
                    Another useful service would be the installation of surveillance cameras to prevent damage or theft of books. Some readers tear pages or take books without checking them out properly, which affects others who need the same resources. Comfortable seating, such as couches, cushions, and reading pods, could also help readers stay longer and read with ease. Additionally, creating a small garden or reading corner in the open air could give readers a refreshing space to relax while enjoying their books.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, adding a small café or snack area would be helpful, especially for readers who spend long hours in the library. They could have tea, coffee, or light snacks without needing to leave the premises. Together, these services would not only improve the library experience but also encourage more people to develop a love for reading and lifelong learning.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. Write an essay on Libraries and its uses for students.</span><br>
                    Libraries are essential places for students as they provide free access to a wide variety of books, reference materials, newspapers, and digital resources. Students who cannot afford to buy all the books they need can benefit greatly from libraries. They can find textbooks, research materials, and past exam papers, all under one roof. This helps students complete their assignments, prepare for exams, and gain deeper knowledge on various subjects without financial burden.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to academic support, libraries help students develop good reading habits, self-learning skills, and concentration. The quiet and peaceful environment encourages focused study and independent thinking. Libraries also offer spaces for group work and discussions, promoting collaboration. With digital advancements, many libraries now provide internet access and e-books as well. Overall, libraries remain powerful tools for students to learn, grow, and succeed in their educational journey.
