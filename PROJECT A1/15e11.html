                        “What I Require from Life” is a beautiful and thoughtful poem by the great Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. In this poem, Tagore expresses his simple but deep desires from life. Instead of asking for wealth, power, or fame, the poet talks about the small, essential things that make life meaningful and joyful. Through gentle and sincere words, he invites readers to think about what truly matters in life.<br><br>

The poem begins with the poet saying that he does not want wealth or grandeur. He is not interested in riches or great palaces, nor does he wish to have followers or a large crowd of admirers. Instead, he desires the quiet and honest things in life—things that bring peace to the heart. This sets the tone of the poem as a reflection on true happiness rather than superficial success.<br><br>

Tagore then asks for a simple meal, a humble shelter, and a companion who understands him. He talks about wanting love and friendship that are genuine, not based on status or appearance. He also mentions the desire for a little space where he can enjoy nature’s beauty, listen to the birds, and see the green fields. These images highlight the poet’s love for nature and simple living, emphasizing contentment with what life naturally offers.<br><br>

Throughout the poem, the poet emphasizes the importance of humility and sincerity. He wants a life free from falsehood, pretence, and cruelty. Tagore values kindness and truthfulness above all and asks that his life be touched by these qualities. He also hopes for the strength to face difficulties calmly and gracefully, showing a mature understanding of life’s challenges.<br><br>

In the final lines, Tagore wishes for a life where he can remain free and peaceful, connected with both nature and humanity. His requirements from life are minimal but deeply meaningful. The poem teaches us that happiness is found in simple joys, love, and honesty, rather than material wealth or power. Tagore’s vision encourages readers to seek inner peace and live with compassion.<br><br>

In conclusion, “What I Require from Life” is a gentle reminder to focus on what truly matters. It urges us to appreciate simplicity, embrace nature, and cherish love and truth. Tagore’s poem is timeless in its message, inviting everyone to rethink their desires and find fulfillment in life’s simple blessings.<br><br>

                        The writer describes a peaceful age as a time of calm and safety where people live comfortably. In contrast, a heroic age is full of challenges and struggles that require bravery and heroic deeds.

                        The writer wants greater freedom of speech so he can openly express his thoughts and ideas without fear, which he believes is important for learning, growth, and progress.

                        The writer explains that a desire is something people want but can live without, while a demand is a basic necessity essential for life and well-being.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">a. “The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.”</strong><br>
                        In this line, the writer contrasts the temporary excitement of a thrill with the lasting fulfillment that comes from adventure. A thrill is a quick, intense feeling of excitement or pleasure that often fades away almost immediately. It might come from a momentary experience—like a sudden rush of adrenaline or a brief enjoyment—but it lacks depth and permanence. The writer suggests that chasing only such fleeting thrills leaves a person empty because these moments do not contribute to real growth or a meaningful life. Thrills are often superficial pleasures that provide temporary distraction but no lasting satisfaction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        On the other hand, the writer emphasizes that the satisfaction gained from adventure is far more substantial and enduring. Adventure involves facing challenges, taking risks, and exploring new possibilities, which require courage and perseverance. The feelings that come from these experiences build character and provide a deep sense of achievement and purpose. Unlike a fleeting thrill, the satisfaction of adventure stays with a person, shaping their identity and strengthening their spirit. The writer values this solid satisfaction because it enriches life in a meaningful way and helps a person grow beyond momentary pleasures to something truly fulfilling and rewarding.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">b. “I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their own and their friends’ well-being.”</strong><br>
                        In this line, the writer expresses a strong desire for fairness and justice in how the results of labor are shared. He wants workers to directly benefit from their hard work rather than seeing others—such as owners or managers—reap the profits. The writer believes that when people put effort into their work, they should be able to enjoy its rewards personally. This reflects his concern for social equity and the dignity of labor, emphasizing that workers deserve to live comfortably and support their families through their own efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        Furthermore, the writer’s wish extends beyond individual gain to the well-being of friends and the wider community. He envisions a society where the fruits of work contribute to the happiness and security of everyone involved, not just a privileged few. This idea underlines the importance of collective welfare and the belief that prosperity should be shared to create a more just and compassionate world. The writer’s focus on well-being highlights his hope for a balanced life where work leads to meaningful and tangible benefits for all.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?</strong><br>
                        The essayist refers to ancient philosophers to add authority and depth to his ideas. Ancient philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are widely respected for their thoughtful exploration of human nature, ethics, and society. By linking his thoughts to these well-known figures, the essayist shows that his ideas about freedom, security, and what life requires are not just personal opinions but are grounded in centuries of philosophical thought. This connection lends weight to his arguments and encourages readers to consider them seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        Moreover, the essayist uses these references to emphasize that the basic needs and aspirations of human beings are universal and timeless. The concerns about living a good life, having freedom of thought, and seeking security have been debated and valued across different cultures and ages. By recalling the wisdom of the past, the essayist reminds us that these ideas remain relevant today and continue to guide how we think about life and society. It also shows that the quest for meaning and justice is an ongoing journey shared by humanity throughout history.

                        The language of the essay is clear, direct, and persuasive. The writer uses simple yet powerful words to express his ideas, making them easy to understand for a wide audience. The tone is serious and thoughtful, reflecting the importance of the subject. At times, the language is emotional and passionate, especially when the writer talks about freedom, security, and justice, which helps engage the reader and emphasize the urgency of his demands.

                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        The purpose of the essay is to express the writer’s vision of what a meaningful and fulfilling life should include. He aims to highlight basic human needs such as freedom, security, and love, and to urge society to recognize and respect these needs. The subject revolves around human rights, dignity, and social justice, focusing on the writer’s personal demands as well as universal aspirations. The point of view is personal and reflective, as the writer shares his own thoughts and desires while also addressing broader social issues. The mode of writing is expository and argumentative, where the writer explains his ideas logically and supports them with examples and references to philosophers. Overall, the essay combines personal reflection with social critique to provoke thought and inspire change.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?</strong><br>
                        To be truly happy and satisfied in life, I believe several essential elements must come together. First and foremost, I require a strong sense of security. This means feeling safe in my surroundings, having good health, and enjoying financial stability that allows me to meet basic needs like food, shelter, and education. When these fundamentals are secure, it creates a foundation where I can live peacefully without constant fear or stress. Emotional security is equally important, which comes from having supportive relationships with family and friends who provide love and encouragement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        In addition to security, I require freedom—the freedom to think independently, express my opinions openly, and make choices that reflect my true self. Without freedom, life feels restrictive and unfulfilling. Being able to pursue my passions, explore new opportunities, and learn from experiences is what makes life meaningful and exciting. Lastly, love and human connection are vital for my happiness. Having caring relationships where mutual respect and understanding exist gives life warmth and joy. When security, freedom, and love come together, they create a balanced and fulfilling life, helping me grow as a person and find lasting happiness.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?</strong><br>
                        Socialism is an economic and political system where the means of production, such as factories, land, and resources, are owned and controlled collectively by the community or the state. The main idea behind socialism is to reduce inequality by distributing wealth more fairly and ensuring that everyone has access to basic needs like education, healthcare, and housing. Socialism emphasizes cooperation, social welfare, and the idea that the benefits of work should be shared by all members of society, not just a few individuals or private owners.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        In contrast, capitalism is a system where the means of production are privately owned and operated for profit. It encourages competition, private property, and individual entrepreneurship. Under capitalism, wealth is distributed based on market forces and individual success, which can lead to significant economic growth but also greater inequality. While capitalism focuses on personal freedom and profit motive, socialism stresses social justice and equal opportunity. The fundamental difference between the two systems lies in ownership and how resources and wealth are managed and shared within society.

                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
                        My dream house is a place where comfort, beauty, and peace blend perfectly to create a warm and welcoming home. I imagine it located in a quiet, green neighborhood, surrounded by tall trees, colorful flowers, and fresh air, providing a close connection with nature. The house would be spacious enough to allow each family member their own private space, yet designed in a way that encourages togetherness and shared moments. Large windows all around would let in plenty of natural sunlight, making the rooms bright and cheerful throughout the day.
                    </p>

                        Inside, my dream house would have a cozy living room furnished with comfortable sofas and decorated with artwork that reflects my personality. The kitchen would be modern and well-equipped, a place where delicious meals can be prepared and shared. I would also want a dedicated study or library room, quiet and peaceful, where I can read, work, and think without interruption. The bedrooms would be calm and inviting, perfect for rest and relaxation after a busy day. Outside, a beautiful garden with a variety of plants and flowers would be essential, providing a peaceful spot for morning tea or evening conversations. I imagine my dream house as more than just a building — it is a sanctuary filled with love, laughter, and happiness, where family and friends always feel at home.
