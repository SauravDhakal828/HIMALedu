                        “What is Poverty?” is a thought-provoking chapter that explores the meaning and nature of poverty beyond just the lack of money. It explains that poverty is not only about being poor financially but also involves deprivation in many aspects of life, such as education, healthcare, and basic living standards. The chapter encourages readers to understand poverty as a complex and multi-dimensional problem that affects millions of people worldwide.<br><br>

The chapter begins by defining poverty in simple terms: it is the state of being extremely poor or lacking enough resources to meet basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. However, the chapter goes further by explaining that poverty is also about the lack of access to opportunities. For example, people who cannot afford education or healthcare are also considered poor because they are deprived of the chance to improve their lives.<br><br>

It explains how poverty leads to a cycle of disadvantages. Poor health, lack of education, and unemployment create barriers that keep people trapped in poverty for generations. The chapter emphasizes that poverty affects not just individuals but entire communities, preventing them from participating fully in social and economic activities. It also highlights that poverty can cause social exclusion and inequality.<br><br>

The chapter also discusses different types of poverty. Absolute poverty means lacking the most basic necessities to survive, while relative poverty refers to being poor compared to others in society. It mentions that poverty exists in both rural and urban areas, but the causes and effects can vary. For example, rural poverty may result from lack of land or farming resources, while urban poverty may come from unemployment or high living costs.<br><br>

Towards the end, the chapter stresses the importance of understanding poverty correctly so that effective measures can be taken to reduce it. It calls for efforts from governments, communities, and individuals to address the root causes of poverty through education, healthcare, job creation, and social welfare programs. The chapter also inspires readers to show empathy and work towards a fairer society where everyone has equal opportunities.<br><br>

In conclusion, “What is Poverty?” provides a comprehensive view of poverty as more than just a lack of money. It encourages awareness of the many ways poverty limits human potential and calls for collective action to fight poverty and bring about social justice and equality.<br><br>

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">a. What is poverty according to Parker?</strong><br>
                        Poverty is a combination of physical hardship and emotional stress, including poor living conditions, illness, lack of proper food, and constant worry about making ends meet.

                        Poverty causes Parker’s children to face poor health, hunger, lack of proper clothing, and the stress of living in unsafe, unsanitary homes.

                        Parker tries to get help from welfare agencies and charities but faces rejection, long waiting times, and complicated procedures.

                        People judge her harshly, assuming poverty is due to laziness or bad choices, which makes it harder for her to get sympathy or support.

                        She explains that welfare is insufficient and humiliating, education is hard to access for her children, and health clinics often don’t address the root causes of poverty or the chronic nature of her struggles.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">a. Explain: Poverty is looking into a black future.</strong><br>
                        The phrase “Poverty is looking into a black future” captures the deep hopelessness and uncertainty that people living in poverty often face. When someone is poor, they may see their future as bleak, full of struggles, and without clear opportunities for improvement. The “black future” symbolizes a sense of darkness, where possibilities seem limited or even nonexistent. It reflects the fear and anxiety about what lies ahead—whether it’s about providing basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare or concerns about education and a better life for their children. Poverty traps people in a cycle where the immediate hardships cloud their hopes and make it difficult to envision a brighter tomorrow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        Moreover, this idea highlights the psychological and emotional burden of poverty, not just the physical or material lack. It’s not only about what is missing in the present but also about the despair that comes from imagining a life filled with ongoing hardship. The “black future” suggests a future shadowed by uncertainty, missed opportunities, and continuous suffering. It emphasizes how poverty steals not only resources but also the ability to dream, plan, and aspire, leaving individuals stuck in a dark place mentally and emotionally, which makes escaping poverty even harder.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">b. What does Parker mean by “The poor are always silent”?</strong><br>
                        When Parker says, “The poor are always silent,” she means that people living in poverty often don’t have a voice in society and are overlooked or ignored. They rarely get the chance to speak up about their struggles because they are marginalized, lack power, or fear judgment and rejection. This silence is not because they have nothing to say but because society often dismisses or ignores their problems. The poor might also feel ashamed or powerless to demand help, leading them to suffer quietly. Their hardships and needs remain hidden, making it harder for others to understand the reality of poverty and offer meaningful support.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        Furthermore, this silence is a result of social and economic barriers that prevent the poor from expressing themselves. The poor may lack education, confidence, or access to platforms where their voices could be heard. Additionally, the stigma and prejudice around poverty can discourage them from speaking out, as they might worry about being blamed or misunderstood. Parker’s statement highlights how this silence contributes to the invisibility of poverty, reinforcing the cycle where the poor remain unheard, unsupported, and trapped in their difficult circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a recurring pattern? What is it?</strong><br>
                        At the beginning of most paragraphs, the author uses a descriptive and reflective writing strategy, often starting with vivid images or direct statements that capture the harsh realities of poverty. This approach immediately draws the reader’s attention to the physical and emotional conditions faced by the poor, such as sickness, hunger, or hopelessness. By using strong, concrete details early on, the author sets the tone for each paragraph and establishes a clear focus. This helps the reader connect emotionally and understand the gravity of the situation right from the start.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        The recurring pattern throughout the text is that the author alternates between personal observations and broader social commentary. Each paragraph often begins with a specific description or example from Parker’s experience and then expands into a reflection on what this means in terms of societal attitudes, obstacles, or systemic problems. This pattern effectively builds a layered understanding of poverty—not just as an individual issue but as a complex social problem that involves prejudice, inadequate help, and silence. The repetition of this structure reinforces the message and keeps the reader engaged throughout the essay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?</strong><br>
                        Parker develops each paragraph by starting with a strong, often personal or vivid statement, then expanding it with specific examples, observations, and reflections that bring her experience of poverty to life. She combines emotional details—such as feelings of exhaustion, fear, or helplessness—with concrete descriptions of her environment, like dirty living conditions or the physical ailments affecting her family. This mix of the emotional and the tangible helps readers not only understand poverty intellectually but also feel its impact deeply. Parker’s use of personal stories and detailed imagery makes her writing authentic and relatable, which strengthens the connection between the reader and the realities she describes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        What makes each paragraph especially memorable are the specific and relatable details Parker includes, such as the struggles her children face with illness or hunger, the way bureaucratic systems fail her, and the judgments she endures from society. These details move beyond abstract ideas to reveal the human side of poverty. Additionally, Parker’s candid tone—her honesty about her fears, frustrations, and resilience—adds emotional weight to her narrative. By balancing hard facts with heartfelt reflections, she creates paragraphs that stay with the reader and challenge common assumptions about poverty. This approach ensures that each section contributes meaningfully to the overall message of the essay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader in the issue of poverty?</strong><br>
                        In the final paragraph, the author uses **rhetorical questions** to actively engage the reader and make them reflect on the harsh realities of poverty. Instead of simply stating facts or conclusions, the questions invite readers to think deeply about the situation and challenge their own perceptions and assumptions. By asking questions, the author shifts the responsibility onto the reader, encouraging them to consider what poverty really means and how society responds to it. This technique creates a sense of involvement and urgency, making the reader an active participant in contemplating the problem rather than just a passive observer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        Moreover, these questions highlight the complexity and persistence of poverty, emphasizing that it cannot be easily solved or ignored. The questions also underline the frustration and helplessness Parker feels, while simultaneously pushing readers to think critically about why poverty continues to exist despite available resources and efforts. This strategy effectively closes the essay with a call for awareness and empathy, leaving a lasting impression that poverty is not just an abstract issue but a pressing human concern that demands attention and action.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating Parker’s style.</strong><br>
                        A social problem is like a shadow that falls across the lives of many, darkening their days and narrowing their chances. It is not just one person’s trouble but a weight that presses on entire communities, often hidden in plain sight yet felt deeply by those who live it. Whether it is homelessness, unemployment, or racism, a social problem strips away dignity and hope, leaving people to wrestle with pain and exclusion. It is a wound that society refuses to fully heal, no matter how many times it is pointed out, and the silence around it only makes the suffering grow louder inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        Like poverty, social problems are tangled webs of unfairness and neglect, where the systems meant to help often fall short or turn a blind eye. They trap people in cycles of hardship, where escaping feels impossible and every day is a struggle against not only material needs but also against judgment, prejudice, and isolation. The faces of these problems are real people—mothers, fathers, children—each carrying stories of dreams deferred and chances missed. And until these problems are seen not as distant issues but as urgent calls for change, the darkness will remain, swallowing hopes and futures alike.

                        <strong class="brighter-gradient-text">b. Using adjectives to highlight the futility of the situation, write a short definition essay on Growing up in Poverty.</strong><br>
                        Growing up in poverty is a harsh and relentless experience marked by constant struggle and despair. It is a confusing and exhausting journey where every step forward is met with overwhelming obstacles and setbacks. Children who grow up in such conditions face bleak and uncertain futures, surrounded by scarcity, neglect, and emotional turmoil. Their lives are shaped by inadequate resources, unhealthy environments, and persistent fear, leaving them vulnerable and isolated. The futility of their situation lies in the unending cycle of deprivation that seems impossible to break, no matter how hard they try.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bright-solid-text mb-2">
                        This experience is not only physically draining but also mentally and emotionally shattering. The children live in a world that is unforgiving, indifferent, and often cruel, where hope is fragile and dreams are easily crushed. The constant presence of poverty creates feelings of helplessness, invisibility, and resignation, making it difficult for them to envision a better life. Growing up in poverty is a grim reminder of society’s failure to protect its most vulnerable, trapping young lives in a frustrating and bleak reality with few opportunities for escape or improvement.
