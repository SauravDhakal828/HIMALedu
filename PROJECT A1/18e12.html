                        “A Matter of Husbands” is a witty one-act play that explores the themes of trust, deception, and the power of performance. Set in a theatrical context, the play revolves around a confrontation between two women — a young, emotional wife and a famous, confident actress — over the suspected infidelity of the wife’s husband. Through clever dialogue and dramatic irony, the play reveals how appearances can be deceptive, especially when actors are involved.<br><br>

The play begins with the young woman visiting the actress in her dressing room. She accuses the actress of seducing her husband, claiming that he has been behaving strangely and that she found a bouquet that suggests romantic involvement. The young wife is visibly distressed and confused, convinced that her marriage is falling apart because of the actress’s charm and influence. This scene immediately introduces the central conflict and sets up the dramatic tension.<br><br>

The actress, however, responds with calmness and sophistication. She denies any romantic involvement with the husband and instead explains that he is likely pretending to be in love with her to rekindle his wife’s affection. According to the actress, men sometimes use such tactics to make their wives jealous and more attentive. She claims that the husband asked her to play along with this act just to provoke a reaction. Her explanation is smooth, logical, and presented so convincingly that the young wife begins to believe her.<br><br>

As the conversation unfolds, the young wife’s anger softens. She starts to doubt her own suspicions and feels foolish for confronting the actress so aggressively. The actress maintains her graceful composure and assures the wife that her husband loves her dearly and was merely trying to win back her attention. By the end of the play, the young woman is reassured and prepares to return to her husband, her jealousy seemingly resolved.<br><br>

However, the real twist occurs in the final moments. As the young woman leaves, satisfied and relieved, the actress quickly calls offstage for her assistant to return “Mr. Della’s” bouquet — the same man the wife had accused her of seeing. This clever ending reveals that the actress may actually be guilty after all. Her calm explanation was possibly a deceptive performance, showing her skill in manipulation and leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is simply part of the act.<br><br>

In conclusion, “A Matter of Husbands” is a brilliant exploration of illusion versus reality. Ferenc Molnár uses the setting of the theater as a metaphor for life itself, where people often wear masks and perform roles. The play leaves the audience with an ambiguous ending and an important lesson: not everything is as it seems, and even the most convincing truth may be a well-acted lie.<br><br>

                    Plot:
                    The play A Matter of Husbands revolves around an earnest young woman who comes to a famous actress pleading for the return of her husband, who has fallen in love with the actress. The young woman is heartbroken but determined to get her husband back. As they talk, the husband secretly hides in a wardrobe, creating a comic and tense situation.

Ultimately, the play explores themes of love, jealousy, and the complexities of relationships, all with a humorous undertone.

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. Sketch the character of Famous Actress.</span><br>
                    The Famous Actress is a confident, charming, and clever woman who commands attention wherever she goes. She is accustomed to the spotlight and knows how to use her wit and acting skills to influence people around her. Throughout the play, she remains composed and self-assured, even when confronted by the Earnest Young Woman, who pleads for her husband’s return.
                    <br><br>
                    The Actress is skilled in manipulation, using her talents not only on stage but also in real life to maintain control of the situation. She speaks with poise and persuasiveness, showing that she is experienced in dealing with complicated emotional scenarios. Despite her glamorous and sophisticated exterior, there is a subtle hint of vulnerability when it comes to her relationship with the husband, suggesting that her feelings for him might be genuine.
                    <br><br>
                    Her character is complex: while she is involved in an affair with the young woman’s husband, she does not appear cruel or malicious. Instead, she is portrayed as a strong woman caught in a love triangle, using her acting prowess to navigate the conflict. Ultimately, the Famous Actress represents the themes of allure, power, and the nuanced nature of love and relationships

                    <span class="font-bold">b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</span><br>
                    In A Matter of Husbands, the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress is emphasized through their behavior, attitude, and approach to emotions and situations.
                    <br><br>
                    Ordinary Woman:
                    An ordinary woman, like the Earnest Young Woman in the play, is sincere, straightforward, and emotionally genuine. She expresses her feelings honestly and openly, especially when it comes to love and relationships. The ordinary woman tends to be vulnerable and deeply affected by personal matters such as her husband’s affection and loyalty. She values sincerity and is less likely to hide her emotions or manipulate situations to her advantage.
                    <br><br>
                    Actress:
                    An actress, on the other hand, is trained to perform, hide her true emotions, and portray different roles convincingly. She has the ability to mask her feelings and manipulate situations through her charm and acting skills. The Famous Actress in the play uses her talent to control the conversation and maintain her hold over the husband. Unlike the ordinary woman, the actress is more calculating, poised, and can separate her personal feelings from the role she plays, both on stage and in real life.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</span><br>
                    According to the Famous Actress, men associated with the theatre often use actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so that they can win them back. She suggests that these men do not always have genuine feelings for the actresses but treat them as tools or pawns in their attempts to regain the love and attention of their wives. In some cases, this may hold true because jealousy can be a strong emotion that pushes a person to realize what they are losing and motivates them to work on the relationship. By showing interest in someone else, men might hope to remind their wives of their importance and encourage them to reconcile. This argument points to the complicated and sometimes manipulative nature of human relationships, where feelings are not always straightforward.
                    <br><br>
                    However, I do not fully agree with the Famous Actress’s argument because it oversimplifies relationships and unfairly stereotypes theatre actresses. Not every relationship involving an actress is a ploy or game. True love and affection can develop naturally between two people, regardless of their professions or backgrounds. Reducing these relationships to mere tactics overlooks the depth of human emotions and the individuality of the people involved. Furthermore, this idea ignores the possibility that the actress herself may have genuine feelings for the man. Relationships are complex and multi-dimensional, and while jealousy might sometimes play a role, it cannot explain or justify all romantic relationships.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">d. How does Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</span><br>
                    The Famous Actress makes a fool of the Earnest Young Woman through her clever manipulation and superior acting skills. When the Earnest Young Woman arrives, desperate and emotional, pleading for the return of her husband, the Actress listens patiently but uses the opportunity to confuse and mislead her. She speaks in a calm and confident manner, twisting the facts and using ambiguous language to make the Young Woman doubt her own understanding of the situation. The Actress’s ability to act convincingly in real life, not just on stage, allows her to control the conversation and maintain an upper hand over the young woman.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, the Actress hides the Earnest Young Woman’s husband in a wardrobe while the two women talk, keeping him physically close but out of sight. This clever trick adds to the Young Woman’s frustration and helplessness because she does not realize that her husband is actually nearby. The Actress’s composed and poised behavior, combined with her strategic hiding of the husband, makes the Young Woman seem naive and powerless in the situation. Through these tactics, the Famous Actress manages to outwit the earnest woman, making her look foolish and exposing the vulnerability of her desperate love.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house as a part of setting play in A Matter of Husbands?</span><br>
                    The theatre as a setting plays a crucial and symbolic role in A Matter of Husbands. The fact that the entire conversation between the Earnest Young Woman and the Famous Actress takes place on the stage of a theatre is very important because a theatre is traditionally a place of acting, pretending, and performance. This setting creates a backdrop where the boundaries between reality and illusion become blurred. The characters are not only performing their emotions through dialogue but also, in a way, “acting” their roles in real life. The Famous Actress, in particular, uses this setting to her advantage by applying her acting skills to manipulate and deceive the Earnest Young Woman, highlighting the theme of appearance versus reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, the theatre setting adds a layer of dramatic irony and humor to the play. The audience is aware that while the two women are arguing and revealing their emotions on the stage, the husband—who is the center of their conflict—is hiding in the wardrobe right there on the same stage, completely unseen by both women. This situation enhances the comic effect of the play and emphasizes the contrast between what is seen and what is hidden, a key theme in the story. The theatre setting also symbolizes the idea that life itself can be like a stage where people put on masks, play roles, and sometimes hide their true intentions and feelings. Thus, the theatre house as the setting deepens the play’s exploration of love, jealousy, deception, and the performative nature of human relationships.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</span><br>
                    The ending of A Matter of Husbands is both surprising and humorous, which makes it memorable and effective. When the husband, who has been hiding in the wardrobe throughout the conversation, finally comes out, it creates a comic twist that highlights the absurdity and confusion in the love triangle. This unexpected moment brings together all the tensions and misunderstandings in a light-hearted way, making the play entertaining without turning too serious or tragic.
                    <br><br>
                    At the same time, the ending also reflects the themes of deception and performance that run throughout the play. The husband’s hiding symbolizes the hidden truths and secrets in relationships, while the way the two women react shows their emotional vulnerabilities. Overall, the ending leaves the audience with a sense of irony and humor, encouraging them to think about the complexities of love and jealousy without taking the situation too seriously. It’s a clever conclusion that suits the play’s tone perfectly.
