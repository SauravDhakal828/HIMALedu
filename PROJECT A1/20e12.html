                        “The Bull” is a satirical Nepali poem by Bhupi Sherchan, translated into English, which critiques the outdated systems of power, pride, and stubbornness deeply rooted in traditional Nepali society. Through the metaphor of a bull, the poet reflects on the blind arrogance and unchanging nature of certain individuals or societal leaders who refuse to adapt, evolve, or make room for progress. The bull in the poem becomes a symbolic representation of such people—those who live in their past glory but are now obsolete.<br><br>

The poem begins with a vivid description of the bull — once strong and glorious, it was a majestic figure, symbolizing strength, respect, and dominance. However, as time passed, the bull grew old, tired, and weak. Yet, despite its declining condition, the bull continues to carry the pride of its youth, refusing to accept its present limitations. The poet sharply criticizes this refusal to accept change, portraying it as a form of foolishness or self-deception. The bull still believes it is the king of the cowshed, even though its relevance has long faded.<br><br>

Sherchan uses the image of the bull to cleverly highlight the human tendency to live in denial, especially among those who once held power. The poem mocks those who think they are still superior and valuable, even when they have outlived their usefulness. Their stubbornness and inability to step aside prevent the new generation from moving forward. In this sense, the poem is not just about an animal but about the outdated ideologies and individuals that dominate society despite having no real contribution in the present.<br><br>

Moreover, the poem indirectly refers to the social and political leaders who, like the old bull, still demand respect based on their past achievements but no longer serve any practical purpose. They resist change and hold on to their position of power, often standing in the way of progress. Sherchan critiques this mindset by showing how ridiculous it is when the bull still expects others to acknowledge its dominance, even as it deteriorates.<br><br>

The tone of the poem is both humorous and critical. Bhupi Sherchan’s use of sarcasm and irony adds a sharp edge to the message, making the reader reflect on the real-life "bulls" they encounter in society. While the poem can be read as a simple allegory, its deeper message challenges power structures, pride, and the failure to accept change. The poet ultimately suggests that true strength lies not in clinging to past power, but in gracefully making way for the future.<br><br>

In conclusion, “The Bull” is a thought-provoking poem that uses simple imagery to convey a powerful social commentary. Through the figure of an old, prideful bull, Bhupi Sherchan urges us to recognize and question the outdated elements of society that still dominate our lives. The poem becomes a call for renewal — a message that change is necessary, and that letting go of obsolete pride is a form of wisdom.<br><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">a. Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</span><br>
                    Gore and Jitman, the cowherds, come to see Laxminarayan to inform him about the death of Male, the bull owned by King Ranabahadur. Since Laxminarayan is the chief courtier, they are afraid of how the king will react and hope he can handle the situation carefully. They are also fearful of being punished, as the bull was considered sacred and held in great regard by the king.

                    <span class="font-bold">b. What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</span><br>
                    According to the cowherds, the bull died of natural causes. They try to explain that Male was very old and weak, and despite their care, his health had declined rapidly. They suggest that no external force or negligence was involved in his death. However, they are still deeply worried because the king may not accept this simple explanation.
                </p>

                    <span class="font-bold">c. Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</span><br>
                    King Ranabahadur wants to see the bull himself because he had a deep emotional attachment to Male. He refuses to believe that the bull could die so suddenly and suspects that foul play might be involved. By seeing the bull with his own eyes, he hopes to confirm the truth and judge the situation for himself rather than relying on others’ words.

                    <span class="font-bold">d. Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar?</span><br>
                    Laxminarayan runs ahead of the royal convoy at Thulo Gauchar to arrange for a substitute bull before the king arrives. Knowing how much the king loved Male and how unpredictable his reactions can be, Laxminarayan fears the consequences of telling the king that the bull is dead. So, he quickly finds a similar-looking bull to pretend that Male is still alive, attempting to deceive the king and avoid punishment.

                    Gore and Jitman cry when the king himself declares that Male is dead because they feel a deep sense of relief. Until then, they were terrified that they might be blamed and punished for the bull’s death. However, since the king accepts the death of Male himself, they are no longer under threat. Their tears express a mix of emotions: fear, relief, and perhaps even sadness for the bull.

                    We learn that the original bull, Male, is dead through the dialogue of Gore and Jitman, who come to report the incident to Laxminarayan. Later, it becomes evident that a replacement bull was used to deceive the king. Eventually, the king realizes the truth and accepts Male’s death, thus confirming the bull's fate. The narrative uses this incident to build tension and irony.

                    <span class="font-bold">g. How does the play make a satire on the feudal system?</span><br>
                    The play satirizes the feudal system by showing how absurd and unjust power structures can be under monarchs. King Ranabahadur’s overreaction to the death of a bull highlights the irrational authority and emotional immaturity of feudal rulers. The fear and flattery shown by the courtiers and cowherds reflect how people under such a system must constantly lie and manipulate to survive. Laxminarayan’s desperate attempt to deceive the king with a lookalike bull mocks the blind obedience and sycophancy common in feudal courts. Overall, the play ridicules the ridiculous priorities and oppressive nature of feudal power.

                    <span class="font-bold">h. Write down the plot of the play in a paragraph.</span><br>
                    The Bull is a satirical one-act play set during the reign of King Ranabahadur Shah. The story begins when two cowherds, Gore and Jitman, inform the chief courtier Laxminarayan that the king’s beloved bull, Male, has died. Fearing the king’s unpredictable anger, Laxminarayan devises a plan to replace the dead bull with another similar-looking one before the king arrives. He runs ahead of the royal convoy to make the arrangements at Thulo Gauchar. Meanwhile, the king insists on seeing the bull himself, unaware of the switch. Eventually, the king sees the new bull and realizes the truth, but instead of punishing anyone, he dramatically accepts the bull's death himself. The play uses humor and irony to expose the absurdities of the feudal system and the fear-driven behavior it produces.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and his subjects as portrayed in the play.</span><br>
                    The play The Bull presents a vivid picture of late eighteenth-century Nepali society, highlighting the oppressive and fear-driven relationship between the king and his subjects under the feudal system. During this period, the king held absolute power, and his words and emotions dictated the fate of everyone around him. The play reveals how people, regardless of their status, were forced to obey the king blindly and live under constant fear of his unpredictable anger.
                    <br><br>
                    King Ranabahadur Shah is shown as an emotionally unstable ruler who places more value on his bull than on human lives. His subjects, like the cowherds Gore and Jitman, are terrified to inform him about the bull’s death, knowing that even such a natural incident could lead to harsh punishment. Laxminarayan, the chief courtier, tries to handle the situation not by telling the truth but by deceiving the king—replacing the dead bull with a similar-looking one. This reflects how dishonesty, manipulation, and flattery were common survival strategies under feudal rule.
                    <br><br>
                    The king’s reaction and the fear of his subjects demonstrate how the society was built on unequal power dynamics. The play satirizes the feudal system by showing that people served the ruler not out of respect or duty, but out of fear for their lives. It exposes the lack of justice, freedom, and dignity experienced by ordinary people, painting a critical picture of the king-subject relationship in eighteenth-century Nepal.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what extent has the Nepali society changed since then?</span><br>
                    The relationship between Laxminarayan and his wives in The Bull reflects the patriarchal structure of eighteenth-century Nepali society, where women were treated as secondary and had little voice or authority. Laxminarayan, as the male head of the household, dominates the relationship. He talks to his wives in a commanding tone and does not consider their opinions seriously. His wives are portrayed as submissive and dependent, showing how women were expected to obey their husbands and remain within the domestic sphere.
                    <br><br>
                    This relationship highlights how gender inequality was deeply rooted in the society of that time. Men held power both in public and private life, while women had limited rights and little influence. Polygamy was also socially acceptable among high-status men, as shown by Laxminarayan having multiple wives.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then, Nepali society has changed significantly, though some traditional attitudes still persist. Today, laws promote gender equality, and women have more opportunities in education, employment, and politics. Women's voices are being heard more in both families and society. However, full equality has not yet been achieved, especially in rural areas where patriarchal values still influence many aspects of life. The change is ongoing, and while progress has been made, challenges remain in achieving a truly equal society.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your society?</span><br>
                    In The Bull, the practice of chakari—the act of flattering or serving someone in power to gain favor—is clearly portrayed through the character of Laxminarayan. As the chief courtier, he constantly tries to please King Ranabahadur Shah, not out of loyalty, but out of fear and self-interest. When the bull dies, Laxminarayan doesn’t inform the king truthfully. Instead, he rushes ahead to replace the dead bull with a similar one to avoid the king’s anger. This shows how chakari encourages dishonesty, manipulation, and blind obedience just to remain in the king’s good books.
                    <br><br>
                    The play satirizes this practice by exposing how people in power often surround themselves with sycophants rather than honest advisors. It also shows how the fear of punishment and the desire for reward lead people to suppress the truth. Chakari, in this context, becomes a survival strategy in a society where speaking truth to power is dangerous.
                    <br><br>
                    This practice is still noticeable in modern Nepali society. Although the political system has changed, many people still engage in chakari—flattering politicians, government officials, or influential figures to get jobs, promotions, or favors. In both government and private sectors, merit is sometimes ignored in favor of personal connections and sycophancy. This shows that while society has progressed, the mindset of depending on powerful individuals through flattery still exists in various forms.

                    <span class="font-bold">d. How does Laxminarayan outsmart Rana Bahadur?</span><br>
                    Laxminarayan outsmarts King Rana Bahadur through quick thinking, clever manipulation, and his deep understanding of the king’s personality. When he hears about the death of Male, the king’s beloved bull, he knows that the king’s reaction will be extreme and possibly dangerous. Instead of reporting the truth immediately, Laxminarayan takes a bold and risky decision—he runs ahead of the royal convoy to Thulo Gauchar and arranges for a similar-looking bull to replace the dead one.
                    <br><br>
                    This act of deception shows Laxminarayan’s intelligence and survival instinct. He understands that the king values emotion over reason and uses this to his advantage. When the king sees the new bull and realizes the truth, Laxminarayan remains calm and allows the king to believe whatever helps him cope emotionally. In the end, the king declares that Male is dead, which saves Laxminarayan from any blame or punishment.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, Laxminarayan outsmarts the king not by confronting him but by controlling the situation with subtle manipulation and psychological insight. He handles a dangerous moment with cleverness, avoiding direct conflict while still maintaining his position and safety.

                    <span class="font-bold">e. Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</span><br>
                    Character Sketch of Laxminarayan from The Bull:
                    <br><br>
                    Laxminarayan is the chief courtier of King Ranabahadur Shah and plays a central role in the play The Bull. He is portrayed as intelligent, cunning, and practical. Faced with the difficult situation of the king’s beloved bull’s death, Laxminarayan quickly thinks of a plan to replace the dead bull with a similar-looking one to avoid the king’s wrath. This shows his ability to act swiftly under pressure and his skill in managing delicate situations.
                    <br><br>
                    However, Laxminarayan’s character also reveals the darker side of court politics. He is not honest or straightforward; instead, he prefers deception and flattery to survive in the unpredictable and fear-driven feudal system. His relationship with the king is based more on manipulation than genuine loyalty. At home, he appears authoritative and dominant over his wives, reflecting the patriarchal norms of his society.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, Laxminarayan is a clever survivor who knows how to navigate power through tact and cunning. While he may lack moral courage, his pragmatism and quick thinking highlight the challenges faced by those living under an authoritarian ruler.
