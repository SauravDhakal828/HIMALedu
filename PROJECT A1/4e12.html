                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. Describe the expository scene of the story.</span><br>
                    The story opens with two treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker, approaching a tropical island by canoe. They move through a thick, deep green forest with a sloppy hill nearby and a small river flowing into the sea. The setting is described vividly, creating a mysterious and adventurous atmosphere as they get closer to the island where the treasure is hidden.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. What does the map look like and how do Evan and Hooker interpret it?</span><br>
                    The map is very old, rough, and worn out, with many folds and creases that make it unclear. Evan interprets the twisting lines on the map as a river and the star as the location of the treasure. Hooker focuses on the dotted and straight lines, considering the path to the lagoon shown on the map.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. How did Evan and Hooker know about the treasure?</span><br>
                    Evans and Hooker learned about the treasure by overhearing a conversation between some Chinese men. They also had a map that showed the location of the buried treasure on the island.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">d. Describe Evan’s dream.</span><br>
                    During their journey, Evan fell asleep and dreamed about the treasure and a Chinese man named Chang-hi. In his dream, Evan saw three Chinese men sitting around a small fire in the forest, speaking quietly in English. Chang-hi was said to have taken gold from a shipwrecked galleon and hidden it on the island. He wanted help to recover it, but a battle broke out, and Chang-hi was brutally killed. Evan suddenly woke up as if someone was calling him.

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">e. What do the two treasure hunters see when they walk towards the island?</span><br>
                    As they walked toward the island, Evan and Hooker saw three palm trees, thick bushes, and dim white flowers near the stream’s mouth. They were surprised to find the dead body of the Chinese man, Chang-hi, which added to the eerie and tense atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">f. In what condition did the treasure hunters find the dead man?</span><br>
                    The dead man was lying in a clear space among the trees with a swollen and purple neck, and his hands and ankles were also swollen. It was clear he had died a violent death.

                    <span class="font-bold">g. How did the treasure hunters try to carry gold ingots to the canoe?</span><br>
                    They used a coat to carry the gold ingots. Hooker held one end of the coat’s collar in his hand, and Evan held the other end, using the coat as a makeshift stretcher to transport the heavy gold ingots.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">h. How were Evan and Hooker poisoned?</span><br>
                    Evan and Hooker were poisoned when a slender, two-inch thorn pricked Hooker’s thumb. The poison caused them both to fall to the ground in pain, and they suffered greatly, eventually leading to their death.

                <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold brighter-gradient-text mb-4">Reference to the Context</h3>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. How do you know the story is set on a tropical island?</span><br>
                    The story is clearly set on a tropical island because of several descriptions that point to a warm, lush environment typical of such islands. For example, the characters travel by canoe toward a coral island under the heat of the sun. The story mentions thick, deep green forests, freshwater lakes and streams, salt marshes, mangrove and coastal forests, as well as coral reefs and deep seas around the island. These natural features—like mangroves, mangroves, coral reefs, and tropical plants—are characteristic of tropical island ecosystems. All these details together confirm that the setting is a tropical island.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. Why do you think Evan and Hooker took such a risk of finding the buried treasure on a desert island?</span><br>
                    Evan and Hooker took the risk of searching for the buried treasure on a desert island primarily because of their strong greed and desire for wealth. The treasure represented a chance to gain a huge fortune, and this prospect was powerful enough to make them willing to face all kinds of dangers and uncertainties. Despite the island being isolated and potentially hazardous, they saw the risk as an exciting challenge that was worth the possible rewards. The idea of finding millions of dollars’ worth of treasure from a shipwrecked galleon made them overlook the dangers, including the threats to their lives. Their intense craving for money, combined with the thrill of adventure, drove them to take such a bold and risky step. Ultimately, their greed blinded them to the consequences that awaited them on the island.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. Do you think the narrator of the story is racist? If yes, what made him feel superior to other races?</span><br>
                    Yes, the narrator of the story does seem to exhibit racist attitudes. Throughout the narrative, there are subtle but clear indications that the narrator regards the white treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker, as superior to the Chinese man, Chang-hi. For example, the Chinese character is portrayed in a negative and somewhat stereotypical manner, and his death is described brutally, almost as if to emphasize his helplessness compared to the two white men. The story also shows Evans and Hooker as dominant, clever, and entitled to the treasure, while Chang-hi is depicted as secretive and inferior.
                    <br><br>
                    The narrator’s language and descriptions reveal a bias that reflects a racial hierarchy, where the white characters are positioned as protagonists and heroes, while the Chinese man is marginalized and victimized. Hooker’s commanding tone toward Evans and the way they dismiss Chang-hi’s claims and efforts further show a sense of racial superiority and entitlement. The fact that the treasure hunters do not hesitate to kill Chang-hi to get the treasure also reflects this dominant attitude.
                    <br><br>
                    This superiority complex stems from colonial-era stereotypes and prejudices, where Western characters were often portrayed as superior in intelligence, morality, and strength compared to non-Western or Asian characters. Such biased representation suggests that the narrator harbors racist feelings, consciously or unconsciously, which shape the story’s portrayal of the characters and their interactions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">d. What do you think is the moral of the story?</span><br>
                    The moral of the story “Treasure in the Forest” highlights the destructive nature of greed and the dangers of selfish ambition. Evan and Hooker’s relentless pursuit of the hidden treasure drives them to take extreme risks, including traveling to a dangerous, unknown island and committing violent acts such as the brutal killing of Chang-hi, the Chinese man who originally guarded the treasure. Their obsession with wealth blinds them to the warnings and hazards around them, showing how greed can cloud a person’s judgment and lead them to make harmful choices. The story reveals that when people prioritize money and material gain above everything else, including morality and safety, they often face severe consequences.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, the fate of Evan and Hooker serves as a cautionary tale. Despite their efforts to claim the treasure, both men fall victim to the island’s poisonous thorns, which symbolize nature’s way of punishing greed and wrongdoing. Their tragic end teaches readers that greed is a self-destructive force—it not only harms others but can also ruin the greedy themselves. Instead of chasing after riches at any cost, the story encourages people to find contentment with what they have, to act with integrity, and to value life and relationships over material wealth. True happiness and fulfillment come from living wisely and ethically, rather than from reckless pursuit of money and power.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. Interpret the story as a mystery story.</span><br>
                    The story “Treasure in the Forest” can be interpreted as a mystery story because it contains many elements that create suspense and keep the reader guessing. From the beginning, the setting—a thick, dark forest on a remote island—adds an eerie and mysterious atmosphere.

                    <br><br>
                    These mysterious events build tension and curiosity as the reader tries to understand what will happen next and who will succeed in finding the treasure.

                    <span class="font-bold">b. Treasure hunting is a favorable subject of children’s story. Remember a treasure hunting story you read in your childhood and compare and contrast it with ‘The Treasure in the Forest.’</span><br>
                    Treasure hunting is a popular and exciting subject in children’s stories because it sparks adventure, curiosity, and imagination. One famous treasure hunting story from childhood is “Treasure Island” by Robert Louis Stevenson. Both “The Treasure in the Forest” and “Treasure Island” center around the quest for hidden riches and involve maps, mysterious islands, and dangerous journeys.
                    <br><br>
                    In “Treasure Island,” the story follows young Jim Hawkins, who discovers a treasure map and sets out on an adventure filled with pirates, friendship, and bravery. The tone is adventurous and often exciting, with vivid characters like Long John Silver who add charm and complexity to the story. Although there are dangers, the story is suitable for children and has a clear sense of good versus evil, with lessons about courage and loyalty.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, “The Treasure in the Forest” is darker and more violent. The treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker, are driven by greed and are willing to kill to get the treasure. The story’s tone is more serious and suspenseful, highlighting the dangers and consequences of selfishness. Unlike “Treasure Island,” which ends with hope and survival, “The Treasure in the Forest” ends tragically, with the hunters dying from poisoning.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, while both stories involve treasure hunting and adventure, “Treasure Island” is more suited for children with its adventurous spirit and moral lessons about bravery, whereas “The Treasure in the Forest” serves as a cautionary tale about greed and its destructive effects, with a more mature and dark tone.
