                        The story revolves around a self-proclaimed astrologer who sets up his business under a tamarind tree in a bustling marketplace.
                        He has no real astrological knowledge but relies on his shrewd observations, quick wit, and a good understanding of human psychology to make a living.
                        One evening, as he is about to pack up, a stranger approaches him. The astrologer recognizes the man as Guru Nayak, a person he had attempted to murder years ago.
                        Guru Nayak is searching for the man who tried to kill him. The astrologer, fearing exposure, cleverly uses his "powers" to warn Guru Nayak against traveling south and reveals details about his past, including the attack, without admitting his own involvement.
                        He convinces Guru Nayak that his attacker is dead and advises him to return home, promising prosperity.
                        Relieved and safe, the astrologer returns home, confesses his past to his wife, and feels a great burden lifted from his conscience.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. In this story, what details contributed to your feelings of suspense and surprise? Explain.</span><br>
                    In the story, several details build a strong sense of suspense. The stranger’s unexpected arrival and his intense, secretive behavior immediately create tension.

                    <br><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">i. Who is the speaker?</span><br>
                    The speaker is the stranger who comes to the astrologer. He is cautious and wants to ensure that his words will be valued before revealing anything.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="font-bold">ii. Who is he speaking to?</span><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">iii. What does the expression ‘open my mouth’ mean?</span><br>
                    The expression ‘open my mouth’ means to start speaking or to reveal the information he is keeping secret.

                    <span class="font-bold">c. What details and techniques does the author use to describe the astrologer?</span><br>
                    The author uses vivid physical descriptions to paint a clear picture of the astrologer. The saffron turban he wears is a significant detail, symbolizing spirituality and giving him a striking, holy appearance that naturally draws people’s attention. His sharp, bright eyes are described as having a prophetic glow, which makes him seem wise and almost supernatural. These physical traits help create an image of a confident and knowledgeable man, encouraging people to believe in his powers.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides appearance, the author uses the astrologer’s speech and behavior to deepen his character. Through the astrologer’s calm, witty, and sometimes bold dialogue, readers see his intelligence and street-smart nature. He carefully listens, analyzes people’s reactions, and cleverly provides answers that satisfy his customers. The author also shows the astrologer’s resourcefulness when he confronts the stranger, revealing his courage and quick thinking. By combining detailed physical description, expressive dialogue, and revealing actions, the author creates a multi-dimensional character who is both intriguing and believable.

                    <span class="font-bold">d. What is ironic about Guru Nayak’s meeting with the astrologer?</span><br>
                    The meeting between Guru Nayak and the astrologer is deeply ironic because Guru Nayak unknowingly visits the very man he once tried to kill. In the past, Guru Nayak attempted to murder the astrologer, but the astrologer escaped and started a new life. Now, without realizing it, Guru Nayak seeks guidance and advice from the astrologer, who holds all the knowledge of his past actions. This situation is full of dramatic irony because the reader knows the true identities and history of both characters, while Guru Nayak remains unaware for most of their interaction.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, the astrologer, who was once the victim of Guru Nayak’s violence, now has control over him by using his knowledge and wit. Instead of seeking revenge through force, the astrologer uses intelligence to turn the tables and maintain power. This reversal of roles—where the victim gains power over the attacker in a peaceful but clever way—adds a strong element of situational irony to the story. It highlights how fate and circumstances can bring unexpected twists to human relationships.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">e. How does the astrologer’s manner of dress suit his character?</span><br>
                    The astrologer’s manner of dress is very carefully chosen to match his character and profession. He wears a saffron-colored turban, which is traditionally associated with spirituality, holiness, and wisdom in Indian culture. This turban immediately gives him an aura of mysticism and respectability, making people believe that he has special knowledge and divine insight. This helps him attract customers who are looking for answers and guidance, as they naturally trust someone who looks the part of a wise and holy man.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to the turban, the astrologer’s overall neat and confident appearance reinforces his image as a knowledgeable and trustworthy person. His dress helps him maintain an air of authority and professionalism, which is important since he relies on this image to convince others of his powers. Even though he is not truly a learned astrologer, his well-chosen attire allows him to create a successful illusion, blending appearance with clever behavior to establish his credibility. This careful attention to dress supports both his public persona and his ability to survive and thrive in a challenging environment.

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. What does the astrologer’s popularity tell you about the people of the town?</span><br>
                    The astrologer’s popularity reveals a lot about the mindset and culture of the people living in the town. It shows that they are deeply interested in knowing their future and often feel uncertain or anxious about what lies ahead. Many people face problems related to money, relationships, and family, and they turn to astrology as a way to find answers and hope. This reliance on the astrologer suggests that the townspeople seek comfort in predictions to cope with their worries and fears.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, the townspeople’s trust in the astrologer indicates that traditional beliefs and superstitions hold a strong place in their lives. They are willing to believe in supernatural powers and fate, showing how cultural and religious influences shape their behavior. The astrologer’s success reflects the human desire for guidance and reassurance during difficult or confusing times, highlighting how people often look for meaning beyond what they can see or control

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">b. Why do most people want to know their future? Do you think astrologers can really help them know their future?</span><br>
                    Most people want to know their future because the future is uncertain and unpredictable, which often causes anxiety and fear. By seeking knowledge about what might happen, they hope to gain some control over their lives and be better prepared for challenges or opportunities. Knowing the future can bring comfort, hope, and a sense of security, especially when people face important decisions related to love, career, health, or family. It helps them feel less helpless and more confident about moving forward.
                    <br><br>
                    As for whether astrologers can really predict the future, opinions vary. Many people believe astrology provides valuable insights and guidance, helping them understand themselves and their circumstances better. However, scientifically, there is no concrete evidence that astrologers can accurately foresee specific future events. Often, astrologers use general statements and careful observation to offer advice that seems convincing. Therefore, while astrologers may provide emotional support and direction, it is important for individuals to use their own judgment and efforts to shape their future rather than relying entirely on predictions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-4 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. Is astrology a good practice of fortune telling or just blind faith? Give reasons.</span><br>
                    Astrology can be seen both ways depending on one’s perspective. Some people consider it a meaningful practice because it offers insights into personality traits, relationships, and possible life events based on the positions of stars and planets. For them, astrology provides comfort, guidance, and a way to reflect on life’s challenges, helping them make decisions with more confidence.
                    <br><br>
                    On the other hand, astrology can also be seen as blind faith because it lacks scientific proof and often relies on vague or general statements that could apply to anyone. Many critics argue that believing blindly in astrology can prevent people from taking responsibility for their actions and making practical decisions. Therefore, while astrology might offer emotional support, it should not replace critical thinking and personal effort in shaping one’s life.
