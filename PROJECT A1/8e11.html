                        “Corona Says” is a thought-provoking poem written by the Nepali poet and educationist Vishnu S. Rai during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The poem presents the voice of the coronavirus itself, speaking directly to human beings in a calm, reflective, and almost philosophical tone. Rather than expressing anger or destruction, the virus explains the purpose of its arrival and offers a serious critique of human behavior and modern civilization.<br><br>

The poem begins with a bold and surprising idea: Corona is not the enemy, nor is it here to destroy the world. Instead, it says, “I have not come here of my own will.” This line immediately shifts the tone from fear to reflection. It presents the virus as a messenger or symbol, not a villain. The virus blames humans for forcing nature to respond in this way. It suggests that its arrival is the result of human greed, carelessness, and selfishness.<br><br>

Corona observes that for centuries, humans have believed they are the supreme rulers of the Earth, thinking they own nature and everything in it. In their desire for development, wealth, and power, humans have exploited the environment, cut down forests, killed animals, polluted rivers, and ignored the balance of nature. The poem criticizes this arrogance and abuse of the Earth, reminding readers that humans have crossed their limits.<br><br>

The virus also points out the irony of human life. Even though people live in large cities filled with concrete buildings, factories, and machines, they are emotionally distant. The virus says that in modern life, people don't have time for love, care, or family. Instead, they are busy chasing money, technology, and status. Through the pandemic, however, people were forced to stop, stay at home, and face their own behavior.<br><br>

Corona challenges humans to rethink their values. It says that the Earth is not only for humans, but also for animals, birds, insects, and all forms of life. The virus becomes a symbol of nature’s warning, asking humans to slow down, live in balance, and respect the planet. It warns that if humans don’t learn from this experience, worse things may come in the future.<br><br>

The poem ends on a reflective note, encouraging humanity to wake up and change before it’s too late. It delivers a strong moral message: development is meaningless if it destroys nature and distances people from love, compassion, and human connection.<br><br>

                    <span class="font-bold">c. Why has the speaker come to the Earth?</span><br>
                    The speaker (Corona) has come to Earth as a consequence of humans’ abuse and exploitation of nature. It acts as a reminder of nature’s power and the consequences of human arrogance.

                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">a. What does the speaker mean when he says:</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">“But have you ever counted</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">How many have died so far</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">Because of you and your wars?”</span><br><br>
                    In these lines, the speaker—Corona—is asking humans to reflect deeply on their own actions. While many fear the virus because of the deaths it has caused, the speaker reminds humans that they themselves have been responsible for far greater loss of life through wars, violence, and conflicts throughout history. The speaker wants humans to realize that their own aggression, hatred, and desire for power have led to countless deaths, suffering, and destruction over the years.
                    <br><br>
                    This is a powerful way of holding up a mirror to humanity, showing that the real threat isn’t just from a microscopic virus, but also from the choices and behaviors of humans themselves. It urges people to think about how their wars and conflicts have been far deadlier and more damaging, and perhaps encourages them to change for the better. It’s a call for self-awareness and a reminder of the consequences of human violence.

                    <span class="font-bold">b. Explain the following lines:</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">“I will depart one day.</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">But remember</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">There’re many others like me.</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">They’ll come too.</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">If you don’t get rid of your inflated ego,</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">You’ll be back to your cave time</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">That you endured</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">Long, long, long ago …”</span><br><br>
                    The speaker, Corona, tells us that although it will eventually leave the Earth, it is not the only threat out there. There are many other viruses and challenges waiting to appear if humans do not change their behavior. Corona warns that the human tendency to be arrogant and prideful—referred to as an “inflated ego”—is dangerous. This arrogance makes people believe they are more powerful than nature and can act without consequences, but that mindset will only bring more problems.
                    <br><br>
                    Corona also warns that if humans do not get rid of this ego and continue to disrespect nature, they might have to return to a primitive and difficult way of life, symbolized by the phrase “back to your cave time.” This means losing all the progress and comforts of modern life and suffering hardships similar to those faced by early humans. The message is clear: unless people learn humility and live in harmony with nature, they risk repeating past mistakes and facing great suffering again.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg brighter-gradient-text mb-2 text-justify">
                    <span class="font-bold">c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines?</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">“The earth is not your property alone –</span><br>
                    <span class="italic">It’s as much ours as yours.”</span><br><br>
                    The speaker, Corona, is emphasizing that the Earth does not belong exclusively to humans. Often, people behave as if they are the sole owners of the planet, using its resources freely and without considering the impact on other living beings. This attitude has led to the destruction of forests, pollution of air and water, and harm to animals and plants. However, the speaker reminds us that Earth is a shared home, not only for humans but for countless other creatures — animals, birds, plants, and even microscopic beings like viruses.
                    <br><br>
                    By saying, “It’s as much ours as yours,” the speaker is stressing that every living thing has a rightful place and claim to the Earth. Humans must understand that they are just one part of a larger ecosystem. This line calls for humility and respect towards all forms of life. It urges people to live in harmony with nature, protecting and preserving the environment instead of exploiting it selfishly. The message is clear: Earth is a shared responsibility, and only by acknowledging this can humans ensure a balanced and sustainable future for all inhabitants of the planet.

                    <span class="font-bold">a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people’s lives?</span><br>
                    Many human behaviors contribute significantly to the suffering experienced by people around the world. One of the primary causes is arrogance and pride, where humans develop an inflated ego and consider themselves superior to nature and all other living beings. This arrogance leads to careless exploitation of the Earth’s resources—cutting down forests, polluting air and water, and destroying habitats. Such disrespect for the environment disrupts the natural balance, which in turn causes natural calamities, spread of diseases, and long-term damage to human health and livelihoods.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides environmental harm, human conflicts also play a major role in causing suffering. Wars, violence, and intolerance fueled by greed, hatred, and the desire for power result in loss of life, displacement of people, and destruction of communities. These behaviors create fear, trauma, and instability on both local and global scales. Moreover, selfishness and greed lead to social inequality, poverty, and neglect of the vulnerable sections of society, further deepening human misery. Lack of empathy, compassion, and cooperation prevent people from living peacefully and happily together. The poem warns that unless humans change these harmful behaviors and develop humility, respect, and kindness, the cycle of suffering will continue and may become even more severe in the future.

                    <span class="font-bold">b. How does an epidemic differ from a pandemic? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human life and environment.</span><br>
                    An epidemic is the sudden outbreak of a disease that affects many people within a particular community, region, or country. It is usually limited to a specific geographic area. In contrast, a **pandemic** is an epidemic that spreads over multiple countries or continents, affecting a large number of people worldwide.
                    <br><br>
                    Impact of Coronavirus on human life and environment:
                    <br><br>
                    The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had a profound impact on human life. It caused widespread illness and loss of life, overwhelming healthcare systems globally. The pandemic led to lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures, which disrupted daily life, economies, and education. Many people faced job losses, mental health challenges, and uncertainty about the future.
                    <br><br>
                    On the environment, the pandemic had some positive effects. With reduced human activity, pollution levels dropped, air and water quality improved, and nature started to recover in some areas. However, the pandemic also increased the use of disposable plastics like masks and gloves, which created new environmental challenges. Overall, the pandemic highlighted the close connection between human health and the environment and showed the need for sustainable living.
